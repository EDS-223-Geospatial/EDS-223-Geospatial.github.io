We wi\n\n### Description\n\nCreate a map of Easter Island, including the following:\n\n- [ ] the island's border and road network\n- [ ] elevation of the island (indicated in meters above sea level)\n- [ ] location of the island's volcanoes (indicating their height in meters)\n- [ ] bathymetry surrounding the island (indicated in meters below sea level)\n- [ ] surrounding seamounts (indicating their height in meters)\n\n\n## Part 2: Exploring environmental (in)justice\n\nAs many of us are aware, environmental degradation, pollution, and hazards is not felt equally by all people. Environmental justice has many definitions, but the United States Environmental Protection Agency defines it as follows:\n\n>“Environmental justice” means the just treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of income, race, color, national origin, Tribal affiliation, or disability, in agency decision-making and other Federal activities that affect human health and the environment so that people:\n>\n> - are fully protected from disproportionate and adverse human health and environmental effects (including risks) and hazards, including those related to climate change, the cumulative impacts of environmental and other burdens, and the legacy of racism or other structural or systemic barriers; and\n> - have equitable access to a healthy, sustainable, and resilient environment in which to live, play, work, learn, grow, worship, and engage in cultural and subsistence practices\n\nFor far too long, environmental inequities have been invisible, and thus ignored. Mapping environmental inequities can be a powerful tool for revealing injustices. We will be working with data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's [EJScreen: Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen).\n\nAccording to the [US EPA website](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/purposes-and-uses-ejscreen):\n\n>This screening tool and data may be of interest to community residents or other stakeholders as they search for environmental or demographic information. It can also support a wide range of research and policy goals. The public has used EJScreen in many different locations and in many different ways.\n>\n>EPA is sharing EJScreen with the public:\n>\n> - to be more transparent about how we consider environmental justice in our work,  \n> - to assist our stakeholders in making informed decisions about pursuing environmental justice and,   \n> - to create a common starting point between the agency and the public when looking at issues related to environmental justice.\n\n### Description\n\nFor this assignment, you will explore an environmental justice topic of your choosing. You should select a region, community, or environmental issue that matters to you.\n\nYou must complete the following:\n\n- [ ] create two maps that communicate an environmental justice issue\n- [ ] write a brief paragraph explaining what your maps communicate\n\n### Data details\n\nEJScreen provides on environmental and demographic information for the US at the Census [tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_tract) and [block group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_block_group) levels. You will be working with data at the block group level that has been downloaded from the [EPA site](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/download-ejscreen-data). To understand the associated data columns, you will need to explore the following in the `data` folder:\n\n- Technical documentation: `ejscreen-tech-doc-version-2-2.pdf`\n- Column descriptions: `EJSCREEN_2023_BG_Columns.xlsx`\n\nYou should also explore the [limitations and caveats](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/limitations-and-caveats-using-ejscreen) of the data.\n\nThe following code provides examples for reading and manipulating the EJScreen data. You MUST update this code to suite your problem of interest.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\n\n# read in geodatabase of EJScreen data at the Census Block Group level\nejscreen <- st_read(\"~/data/EJSCREEN_2023_BG_StatePct_with_AS_CNMI_GU_VI.gdb/\") \n\n# filter to a state you are interested in\ncalifornia <- ejscreen %>%\n  filter(ST_ABBREV == \"CA\") \n\n# filter to a county you are interested in\nsanta_barbara <- ejscreen %>%\n  filter(CNTY_NAME %in% c(\"Santa Barbara County\"))\n\n# find the average values for all variables within counties\ncalifornia_counties <- aggregate(california, by = list(california$CNTY_NAME), FUN = mean)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Rubric (specifications)\n\n",
