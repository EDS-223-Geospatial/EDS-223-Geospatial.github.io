## Background
Marine aquaculture has the potential to play an important role in the global food supply as a more sustainable protein option than land-based meat production.[^hall] [Gentry et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0257-9) mapped the potential for marine aquaculture globally based on multiple constraints, including ship traffic, dissolved oxygen, and bottom depth. They found that global seafood demand could be met using less than 0.015% of the global ocean area[^gentry] 

## Description
For this assignment, you are tasked with determining which Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) on the West Coast of the US are best suited to developing marine aquaculture for several species of oysters ***and*** a species of your choice. Suitable locations will be determined based on range of suitable sea surface temperature (SST) and depth values for the species.

To make your workflow generalizable, you must create a function that has the following characteristics:

- **arguments:**
  - minimum and maximum sea surface temperature
  - minimum and maximum depth
  - species name
- **outputs:**
  - map of EEZ regions colored by amount of suitable area
    - species name should be included in the map's title

:::{.callout-tip icon=true}
# Tip: Building a generalizable workflow

Remember, functions can be hard to debug! So it's highly recommended that you build the workflow for a single species (not in a function). Then you can start translating your workflow into a function by identifying the pieces that need to be generalized. 

**Questions to ask yourself:**
which variables can stay the same for each species and which ones would need to change?

## Data details

### Suitable growing conditions
#### Oysters
Research has shown that oysters need the following conditions for optimal growth:

-   sea surface temperature: 11-30&deg;C
-   depth: 0-70 meters below sea level

#### Choose-your-own species
You can find information on species depth and temperature requirements on [SeaLifeBase](https://www.sealifebase.ca/search.php). Remember, we are thinking about the potential for marine aquaculture, so these species should have some reasonable potential for commercial consumption. 

### Sea Surface Temperature
We will use average annual sea surface temperature (SST) from the years 2008 to 2012 to characterize the average sea surface temperature within the region. The data we are working with was originally generated from [NOAA's 5km Daily Global Satellite Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly v3.1](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/index_5km_ssta.php).

**Data files:**

 -   `average_annual_sst_2008.tif`
 -   `average_annual_sst_2009.tif`
 -   `average_annual_sst_2010.tif`
 -   `average_annual_sst_2011.tif`
 -   `average_annual_sst_2012.tif`

### Bathymetry
To characterize the depth of the ocean we will use the [General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO)](https://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/#area).[^gebco]

**Data file:** `depth.tif`

### Exclusive Economic Zones
We will be designating maritime boundaries using Exclusive Economic Zones off of the west coast of US from [Marineregions.org](https://www.marineregions.org/eez.php).

**Data file:** `wc_regions_clean.shp`

## Workflow outline

Below is an outline of the steps you should consider taking to achieve the assignment tasks. 

### Prepare data
To start, we need to load all necessary data and make sure it has the coordinate reference system. 

- shapefile for the West Coast EEZ
- bathymetry raster
- SST rasters
  - combine SST rasters into a raster stack

:::{.callout-tip icon=true}

Make sure to check that these datasets have the same coordinate reference systems! If not, transform them to match.

:::

### Process data
Next, we need to process the SST and depth data so that they can be combined. In this case the SST and depth data have slightly different resolutions, extents, and positions. 

-   find the mean SST from 2008-2012 (e.g. create single raster of average SST)
-   convert average SST from Kelvin to Celsius
    -   hint: subtract by 273.15
-   crop depth raster to match the extent of the SST raster
-   note: the resolutions of the SST and depth data do not match
    -   resample the depth data to match the resolution of the SST data using the nearest neighbor approach
-   check that the depth and SST match in resolution, extent, and coordinate reference system
    -   hint: can the rasters be stacked?
    

### Find suitable locations
To find suitable locations for marine aquaculture, we'll need to find locations that are suitable in terms of both SST and depth.

-   reclassify SST and depth data into locations that are suitable for oysters
    -   hint: set suitable values to `1` and unsuitable values to `0`
-   find locations that satisfy both SST and depth conditions

:::{.callout-tip icon=true}
# Tip: finding suitable locations

The SST and depth rasters should now identify the suitability of locations as `0` or `1`. To find locations that have both suitable temperature and depth, you can use map algebra. One idea is to multiple the values of the cells, using the `lapp()` function.

:::

### Determine the most suitable EEZ 
We want to determine the total suitable area within each EEZ in order to rank zones by priority. To do so, we need to find the total area of suitable locations within each EEZ.

-   select suitable cells within West Coast EEZs
-   find area of grid cells
-   find the total suitable area within each EEZ
    -   hint: it might be helpful to rasterize the EEZ data
