Phenology is the timing of life history events. Important phenological events for plants involve the growth of leaves, flowering, and senescence (death of leaves). Plants species adapt the timing of these events to local climate conditions to ensure successful reproduction. Subsequently, animal species often adapt their phenology to take advantage of food availability. As the climate shifts this synchronization is being thrown out of whack. Shifts in phenology are therefore a common yardstick of understanding how and if ecosystems are adjusting to climate change.

Plant species may employ the following phenological strategies:

- **Winter deciduous**: lose leaves in the winter, grow new leaves in the spring
- **Drought deciduous**: lose leaves in the summer when water is limited
- **Evergreen**: maintain leaves year-round

This lab is based on a materials developed by Chris Kibler.

## Task
In this lab we are analyzing plant phenology near the Santa Clara River which flows from Santa Clarita to Ventura. We will investigate the phenology of the following plant communities:

- **Riparian forests**: grow along the river, dominated by winter deciduous cottonwood and willow trees
- **Grasslands**: grow in openspaces, dominated by drought deciduous grasses
- **Chaparral shrublands**: grow in more arid habitats, dominated by evergreen shrubs

To investigate the phenology of these plant communities we will a time series of Landsat imagery and polygons identifying the locations of study sites within each plant community.

Our goals in this lab are:

- Convert spectral reflectance into a measure of vegetation productivity (NDVI)
- Calculate NDVI throughout the year
- Summarize NDVI values within vegetation communities
- Visualize changes in NDVI within vegetation communities

## Data

**Landsat's Operational Land Imager (OLI)**

- 8 pre-processed scenes
    - Level 2 surface reflectance products
    - Erroneous values set to NA
    - Scale factor set to 100
    - Bands 2-7
    - Dates in filenname

**Study sites**

- Polygons representing sites
  - *study_site*: character string with plant type

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, include = TRUE)
```

## Prerequisites

Let's load all necessary packages:

```{r load, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(terra)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)
library(tmap)
library(cowplot)
```

## Create NDVI Function

Let's start by defining a function to compute the NDVI. 

- NDVI computes the difference in reflectance in the near infrared and red bands, normalized by their sum. 

```{r ndvi-function}
ndvi_fun <- function(nir, red){
  (nir - red) / (nir + red)
}
```

## Compute NDVI for a Single Scene
We have 8 scenes collected by Landsat's OLI sensor on 8 different days throughout the year.

Let's start by loading in the first scene collected on June 12, 2018:

```{r landsat_20180612 rast, results='hide'}
landsat_20180612 <- rast(here("course-materials", "data", "week8", "landsat_20180612.tif"))
landsat_20180612
```

Now let's update the names of the layers to match the spectral bands they correspond to:
```{r landsat_20180612 names, results='hide'}
names(landsat_20180612) <- c("blue", "green", "red", "NIR", "SWIR1", "SWIR2")
landsat_20180612
```

Now we can apply the NDVI function we created to compute NDVI for this scene using the `lapp()` function. 

- The `lapp()` function applies a function to each cell using layers as arguments.
- Therefore, we need to tell `lapp()` which layers (or bands) to pass into the function. 

The NIR band is the 4th layer and the red band is the 3rd layer in our raster. In this case, because we defined the NIR band as the first argument and the red band as the second argument in our function, we tell `lapp()` to use the 4th layer first and 3rd layer second. 

```{r landsat_20180612 lapp, results='hide'}
ndvi_20180612 <- lapp(landsat_20180612[[c(4, 3)]], fun = ndvi_fun)
ndvi_20180612
```

## Attempt 1: Compute NDVI for All Scences

Now we want to repeat the same operations for all 8 scenes. Below is a possible solution, but it's pretty clunky.

Let's load each layer:

```{r rast}
landsat_20180612 <-rast(here("course-materials", "data", "week8", "landsat_20180612.tif"))
landsat_20180815 <- rast(here("course-materials", "data", "week8", "landsat_20180815.tif"))
landsat_20181018 <- rast(here("course-materials", "data", "week8", "landsat_20181018.tif"))
landsat_20181103 <- rast(here("course-materials", "data", "week8", "landsat_20181103.tif"))
landsat_20190122 <- rast(here("course-materials", "data", "week8", "landsat_20190122.tif"))
landsat_20190223 <- rast(here("course-materials", "data", "week8", "landsat_20190223.tif"))
landsat_20190412 <- rast(here("course-materials", "data", "week8", "landsat_20190412.tif"))
landsat_20190701 <- rast(here("course-materials", "data", "week8", "landsat_20190701.tif"))
```

And rename each layer:

```{r names}
names(landsat_20180612) <- c("blue", "green", "red", "NIR", "SWIR1", "SWIR2")
names(landsat_20180815) <- c("blue", "green", "red", "NIR", "SWIR1", "SWIR2")
names(landsat_20181018) <- c("blue", "green", "red", "NIR", "SWIR1", "SWIR2")
names(landsat_20181103) <- c("blue", "green", "red", "NIR", "SWIR1", "SWIR2")
names(landsat_20190122) <- c("blue", "green", "red", "NIR", "SWIR1", "SWIR2")
names(landsat_20190223) <- c("blue", "green", "red", "NIR", "SWIR1", "SWIR2")
names(landsat_20190412) <- c("blue", "green", "red", "NIR", "SWIR1", "SWIR2")
names(landsat_20190701) <- c("blue", "green", "red", "NIR", "SWIR1", "SWIR2")
```

Next, compute NDVI for each layer:

```{r compute ndvi}
ndvi_20180612 <- lapp(landsat_20180612[[c(4, 3)]], fun = ndvi_fun)
ndvi_20180815 <- lapp(landsat_20180815[[c(4, 3)]], fun = ndvi_fun)
ndvi_20181018 <- lapp(landsat_20181018[[c(4, 3)]], fun = ndvi_fun)
ndvi_20181103 <- lapp(landsat_20181103[[c(4, 3)]], fun = ndvi_fun)
ndvi_20190122 <- lapp(landsat_20190122[[c(4, 3)]], fun = ndvi_fun)
ndvi_20190223 <- lapp(landsat_20190223[[c(4, 3)]], fun = ndvi_fun)
ndvi_20190412 <- lapp(landsat_20190412[[c(4, 3)]], fun = ndvi_fun)
ndvi_20190701 <- lapp(landsat_20190701[[c(4, 3)]], fun = ndvi_fun)
```

Let's combine NDVI layers into a single raster stack.

```{r combine ndvi}
all_ndvi <- c(ndvi_20180612, ndvi_20180815, ndvi_20181018, ndvi_20181103, ndvi_20190122, ndvi_20190223, ndvi_20190412, ndvi_20190701)
```

Now, update the names of each layer to match the date of each image: 

```{r all_ndvi names}
names(all_ndvi) <- c("2018-06-12", "2018-08-15", "2018-10-18", "2018-11-03", "2019-01-22", "2019-02-23", "2019-04-12", "2019-07-01")
```

## Attempt 2: Compute NDVI for All Scenes

The first attempt was pretty clunky and required a lot of copy/pasting. Because we're performing the same operations over and over again, this is a good opportunity to generalize our workflow into a function!

Let's start over and see how we could do this more efficiently.

We'll clear our environment and redefine our function for NDVI:

```{r}
ndvi_fun <- function(nir, red){
  (nir - red) / (nir + red)
}
```

Next, let's first sketch out what operations we want to perform so we can figure out what our function needs:

```{r outline, eval=FALSE}

# Note: this code is not meant to run! 
# We're just outlining the function we want to create

create_ndvi_layer <- function(){
  # Read scene
  landsat <- rast(file)
  # Rename layer
  names(landsat) <- c("blue", "green", "red", "NIR", "SWIR1", "SWIR2")
  # Compute NDVI
  ndvi <- lapp(landsat[[c(4, 3)]], fun = ndvi_fun)
}

# What do we notice as what we need to pass into our function?

```


We want a list of the scenes so that we can tell our function to compute NDVI for each. To do that we look in our data folder for the relevant file.

- Ask for the names of all the files in the **week8** folder
- Set the "pattern" option to return the names that end in .tif (
  - .tif is the file extension for the landsat scenes
- Set the "full.names" option returns the full file path for each scene


```{r list, results='hide', message=FALSE}
files <- list.files(
  here("course-materials", "data", "week8"), pattern = "*.tif", 
  full.names = TRUE)
```

Now let's update our function to work with list of file names we created:

- Pass function a number that will correspond to the index in the list of file names

```{r update function}
create_ndvi_layer <- function(i){
  landsat <- rast(files[i])
  names(landsat) <- c("blue", "green", "red", "NIR", "SWIR1", "SWIR2")
  ndvi <- lapp(landsat[[c(4, 3)]], fun = ndvi_fun)
}
```

Let's test our function by asking it to read in the first file:

```{r}
test <- create_ndvi_layer(1)
```

Now we can use our function to create a NDVI layer for each scene and stack them into a single rasterstack. And then update layer names to match date:

```{r run function}
all_ndvi <- c(create_ndvi_layer(1), create_ndvi_layer(2), create_ndvi_layer(3), create_ndvi_layer(4), create_ndvi_layer(5), create_ndvi_layer(6), create_ndvi_layer(7), create_ndvi_layer(8))

names(all_ndvi) <- c("2018-06-12", "2018-08-15", "2018-10-18", "2018-11-03", "2019-01-22", "2019-02-23", "2019-04-12", "2019-07-01")
```


## Compare NDVI Across Vegetation Communities

Now that we have computed NDVI for each of our scenes (days) we want to compare changes in NDVI values across different vegetation communities.

First, we'll read in a shapefile of study sites:

```{r results='hide'}
sites <- st_read(here("course-materials", "data","week8","study_sites.shp"))
```

And plot study sites on a single NDVI layer:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tm_shape(all_ndvi[[1]]) +
  tm_raster() +
  tm_shape(sites) +
  tm_polygons()
```

### Extract NDVI at Study Sites

Here, we find the average NDVI within each study site. The output of extract is a data frame with rows that match the study site dataset, so we bind the results to the original dataset. 

```{r include=TRUE}
sites_ndvi <- terra::extract(all_ndvi, sites, fun = "mean")

sites_annotated <- cbind(sites, sites_ndvi)
```

We're done! Except our data is very untidy... Let's tidy it up!

- Convert to data frame
- Turn from wide to long format
- Turn layer names into date format

```{r include=TRUE}
sites_clean <- sites_annotated %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  select(-ID) %>%
  pivot_longer(!study_site) %>%
  rename("NDVI" = value) %>%
  mutate("year" = str_sub(name, 2, 5),
         "month" = str_sub(name, 7, 8),
         "day" = str_sub(name, -2, -1)) %>%
  unite("date", 4:6, sep = "-") %>%
  mutate("date" = lubridate::as_date(date))
```

## Plot Results

Let's plot the results:

```{r include=TRUE}
ggplot(sites_clean,
       aes(x = date, y = NDVI,
           group = study_site, col = study_site)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#EAAC8B", "#315C2B", "#315C2B", "#315C2B","#9EA93F")) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "", y = "Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)", col = "Vegetation type",
       title = "Seasonal cycles of vegetation productivity") 
```
