## Learning objectives for discussion section:

- read in spatial objects
  - (we should provide code)
- create map with single spatial object
- create map with multiple spatial objects
- use different types of plotting formats (e.g. `tm_polygons`, `tm_fill`, `tm_dots`, etc.)
- adjust color palettes
- include essential map elements: scale bar & north arrow or graticules
- create an interactive map
- should use `tmap`, but could include bonus challenge to reproduce map using `ggplot2`
- should link to Juliet's map making resource
