## Learning objectives for discussion section:
- topological relationships (e.g. `st_intersects`, `st_touches`, `st_within`)
- distance relationships (`st_distance`, `st_within_distance`) and buffers
- spatial and distance-based joins
- big goal is to be able to understand the output of each of these operations
- to help assist diagnosing output, practice writing error/warning messages and unit tests
