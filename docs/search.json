Therefore, it is appropriate intermediate outputs in addition to final results as well as custom print statements and warning messages to check results.\nEach repository should have:\n\nA brief, but informative name (e.g. “assignment-2” is not acceptable)\nA clear and organized structure\n\nShould include folders for data and scripts, where appropriate\n\nA README\n\nContents should follow the guidance from EDS 296\nAdd a section articulating the skills that you are using in this repo. The idea is to make it easy for potential employers to understand your skills\n\nA .gitignore\n\nThis should include any files that you don’t want git to track (i.e. files that you don’t want pushed to GitHub)\n\nYour revised homework assignment, as a rendered Quarto document (both .qmd and .html files). Include the following updates:\n\nGive it a brief, but informative file name (e.g. hw2.qmd is not acceptable)\nDouble check that all contents meet the standard of professional output\nAny other updates you want to make! Including updating the theme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging repository ownership\n\n\n\nYour homework submissions are technically owned by our GitHub Classroom organization.

In particular, you will use the VNP46A1 to detect differences in night lights before and after the storm to identify areas that lost electric power.\nTo determine the number of homes that lost power, you link (spatially join) these areas with OpenStreetMap data on buildings and roads.\nTo investigate potential socioeconomic factors that influenced recovery, you will link your analysis with data from the US Census Bureau."

    "text": "Data details\n\nNight lights\nUse NASA’s Worldview to explore the data around the day of the storm. There are several days with too much cloud cover to be useful, but 2021-02-07 and 2021-02-16 provide two clear, contrasting images to visualize the extent of the power outage in Texas.\nVIIRS data is distributed through NASA’s Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC). Many NASA Earth data products are distributed in 10x10 degree tiles in sinusoidal equal-area projection. Tiles are identified by their horizontal and vertical position in the grid. Houston lies on the border of tiles h08v05 and h08v06. We therefore need to download two tiles per date.\nAs you’re learning in EDS 220, accessing, downloading, and preparing remote sensing data is a skill in it’s own right! To prevent this assignment from being a large data wrangling challenge, we have downloaded and prepped the following files for you to work with, stored in the VNP46A1 folder.\n\nData files:\n\nVNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif: tile h08v05, collected on 2021-02-07\n\nVNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif: tile h08v06, collected on 2021-02-07\n\nVNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif: tile h08v05, collected on 2021-02-16\n\nVNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif: tile h08v06, collected on 2021-02-16\n\n\n\nRoads\nData file: gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg Typically highways account for a large portion of the night lights observable from space (see Google’s Earth at Night). To minimize falsely identifying areas with reduced traffic as areas without power, we will ignore areas near highways.\nOpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project which creates publicly available geographic data of the world. Ingesting this data into a database where it can be subsetted and processed is a large undertaking. Fortunately, third party companies redistribute OSM data. We used Geofabrik’s download sites to retrieve a shapefile of all highways in Texas and prepared a Geopackage (.gpkg file) containing just the subset of roads that intersect the Houston metropolitan area. \n\n\nHouses\nData file: gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg\nWe can also obtain building data from OpenStreetMap. We again downloaded from Geofabrick and prepared a GeoPackage containing only houses in the Houston metropolitan area.\n\n\n\nSocioeconomic\nWe cannot readily get socioeconomic information for every home, so instead we obtained data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey for census tracts in 2019. The folder ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48.gdb is an ArcGIS “file geodatabase”, a multi-file proprietary format that’s roughly analogous to a GeoPackage file.\n\nYou can use st_layers() to explore the contents of the geodatabase. Each layer contains a subset of the fields documents in the ACS metadata.\n\nThe geodatabase contains a layer holding the geometry information (ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS), separate from the layers holding the ACS attributes. You have to combine the geometry with the attributes to get a feature layer that sf can use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMake sure to check that these datasets have the same coordinate reference systems! If not, transform them to match."

Therefore, you should excluded any locations within 200 meters of all highways in the Houston area.\n\nidentify areas within 200m of all highways\n\nhint: you may need to use st_union\n\nfind areas that experienced blackouts that are further than 200m from a highway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe roads geopackage includes data on roads other than highways. However, we can avoid reading in data we don’t need by taking advantage of st_read’s ability to subset using a SQL query.\nBelow is a SQL query that can be used as an argument in st_read:\n\n\"SELECT * FROM gis_osm_roads_free_1 WHERE fclass='motorway'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the number of homes likely impacted by blackouts\n\nidentify homes that overlap with areas that experienced blackouts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe buildings geopackage includes data on many types of buildings. As with the roads data, we can avoid reading in data we don’t need.\nBelow is a SQL query that can be used as an argument in st_read:\n\n\"SELECT *\nFROM gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1`\nWHERE (type IS NULL AND name IS NULL)`\nOR type in ('residential', 'apartments', 'house', 'static_caravan', 'detached')\""

    "text": "Exploring environmental (in)justice\nAs many of us are aware, environmental degradation, pollution, and hazards is not felt equally by all people. Environmental justice has many definitions, but the United States Environmental Protection Agency defines it as follows:\n\n“Environmental justice” means the just treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of income, race, color, national origin, Tribal affiliation, or disability, in agency decision-making and other Federal activities that affect human health and the environment so that people:\n\nare fully protected from disproportionate and adverse human health and environmental effects (including risks) and hazards, including those related to climate change, the cumulative impacts of environmental and other burdens, and the legacy of racism or other structural or systemic barriers; and\nhave equitable access to a healthy, sustainable, and resilient environment in which to live, play, work, learn, grow, worship, and engage in cultural and subsistence practices\n\n\nFor far too long, environmental inequities have been invisible, and thus ignored. Mapping environmental inequities can be a powerful tool for revealing injustices. We will be working with data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s EJScreen: Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool.\nAccording to the US EPA website:\n\nThis screening tool and data may be of interest to community residents or other stakeholders as they search for environmental or demographic information. It can also support a wide range of research and policy goals. The public has used EJScreen in many different locations and in many different ways.\nEPA is sharing EJScreen with the public:\n\nto be more transparent about how we consider environmental justice in our work,\n\nto assist our stakeholders in making informed decisions about pursuing environmental justice and,\n\nto create a common starting point between the agency and the public when looking at issues related to environmental justice.\n\n\n\nDescription\nFor this assignment, you will explore an environmental justice topic of your choosing. You should select a region, community, or environmental issue that matters to you.\nYou must complete the following:\n\ncreate two maps that communicate an environmental justice issue\nwrite a brief paragraph explaining what your maps communicate\n\n\n\nData details\nEJScreen provides on environmental and demographic information for the US at the Census tract and block group levels. You will be working with data at the block group level that has been downloaded from the EPA site.

The only way to get better at this process is to practice by taking the time to troubleshoot on our own, so you should always plan to start there! The graphic below shows the order in which you should approach different resources for help:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoadblock checklist\nIf you hit a roadblock, run through this checklist to make sure you’ve done your due diligence before bringing your question(s) to a peer, TA, or instructor.\n\nrevisit the course materials - your question may already be answered in the slides, textbook, or discussion section materials\nread the documentation - you can do so directly from RStudio by typing ?function_name in the console\nread the package’s vignette, if available - these are often linked on CRAN under the Documents sections (e.g. see {dplyr} on CRAN) or can be found through the command vignette(package = \"package-name\") and vignette(\"vignette-name\")\ntry Googling! - don’t forget to look back at our suggested troubleshooting and Googling tips (Teach Me How to Google)\n\n\n\nHow to ask questions\nWhen you decide to ask a question to a peer, TA, or instructor be sure to:\n\nProvide context. For example, “I’m trying to do this…” or “I’m working on the task where we do this…”\nShare the specific challenge. “I’m specifically trying to [insert function / package] to do this thing.”\nShare what happens and what you’ve learned. “I repeatedly get an error message that says [this]. I’ve tried [this] and [this]”\nShow your code ideally with a reprex that they can run / test.\nValue and expect the Socratic method, especially in classes and workshops – our goal is to provide critical thinking that is transferable, not just to provide a quick fix for a single error."

During the 1930’s the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC), as part of the New Deal, rated neighborhoods based on their perceived safety for real estate investment. Their ranking system, (A (green), B (blue), C (yellow), D (red)) was then used to block access to loans for home ownership. Colloquially known as “redlining”, this practice has had widely-documented consequences not only for community wealth, but also health.1 Redlined neighborhoods have less greenery2 and are hotter than other neighborhoods.3\nCheck out coverage by the New York Times.\nA recent study found that redlining has not only affected the environments communities are exposed to, it has also shaped our observations of biodiversity.4 Community or citizen science, whereby individuals share observations of species, is generating an enormous volume of data. Ellis-Soto and co-authors found that redlined neighborhoods remain the most undersampled areas across 195 US cities. This gap is highly concerning, because conservation decisions are made based on these data.\nCheck out coverage by EOS."

    "text": "Workflow outline\nBelow is an outline of the steps you should consider taking to achieve the assignment tasks.\n\nPrepare data\nTo start, we need to load all necessary data and make sure it has the coordinate reference system.\n\nshapefile for the West Coast EEZ\nbathymetry raster\nSST rasters\n\ncombine SST rasters into a raster stack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMake sure to check that these datasets have the same coordinate reference systems! If not, transform them to match.\n\n\n\n\nProcess data\nNext, we need to process the SST and depth data so that they can be combined. In this case the SST and depth data have slightly different resolutions, extents, and positions.\n\nfind the mean SST from 2008-2012 (e.g. create single raster of average SST)\nconvert average SST from Kelvin to Celsius\n\nhint: subtract by 273.15\n\ncrop depth raster to match the extent of the SST raster\nnote: the resolutions of the SST and depth data do not match\n\nresample the depth data to match the resolution of the SST data using the nearest neighbor approach\n\ncheck that the depth and SST match in resolution, extent, and coordinate reference system\n\nhint: can the rasters be stacked?\n\n\n\n\nFind suitable locations\nTo find suitable locations for marine aquaculture, we’ll need to find locations that are suitable in terms of both SST and depth.\n\nreclassify SST and depth data into locations that are suitable for oysters\n\nhint: set suitable values to 1 and unsuitable values to 0\n\nfind locations that satisfy both SST and depth conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: finding suitable locations\n\n\n\nThe SST and depth rasters should now identify the suitability of locations as 0 or 1. To find locations that have both suitable temperature and depth, you can use map algebra. One idea is to multiple the values of the cells, using the lapp() function.\n\n\n\n\nDetermine the most suitable EEZ\nWe want to determine the total suitable area within each EEZ in order to rank zones by priority. To do so, we need to find the total area of suitable locations within each EEZ.\n\nselect suitable cells within West Coast EEZs\nfind area of grid cells\nfind the total suitable area within each EEZ\n\nhint: it might be helpful to rasterize the EEZ data"
