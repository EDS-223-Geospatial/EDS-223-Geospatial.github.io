The clustered tracks imply that this species is highly gregarious. Tracks that expand beyond park boundaries, notably on the western side, imply that the elephants could be seeking resources such as food or water outside of the park. Alternatively, error in the GPS location for these points could explain this perceived movement.\nFuther analysis steps could include:\n\nzooming in further to the realized niche\npartitioning the data temporally\nusing metadata to advise how to subset the data to view fewer elephant locations at a time\noverlaying other vector or raster data layers such as surface water and vegetation to understand if the elephants’ movement is driven by these resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\nCitation\nLink\n\n\n\n\nElephant observations\nSlotow R, Thaker M, Vanak AT. 2019.

    "section": "2. Raster objects",
    "text": "2. Raster objects\nIn this section we’ll learn how to create raster data objects by reading in data and how to do basic data manipulations.\n\nCreating raster objects\nThe {terra} package represents raster objects using the SpatRaster class. The easiest way to create SpatRaster objects is to read them in using the rast() function. Raster objects can handle both continuous and categorical data.\nWe’ll start with an example of two datasets for Zion National Park from the spDataLarge package:\n\nsrtm.tif: remotely sensed elevation estimates (continuous data)\nnlcd.tif: simplified version of the National Land Cover Database 2011 product (categorical data)\n\n\n# create raster objects\nzion_elevation &lt;- rast(system.file(\"raster/srtm.tif\", package = \"spDataLarge\"))\nzion_land &lt;- rast(system.file(\"raster/nlcd.tif\", package = \"spDataLarge\"))\n\n# test class of raster object\nclass(zion_elevation)\n\n[1] \"SpatRaster\"\nattr(,\"package\")\n[1] \"terra\"\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmap1 &lt;- tm_shape(zion_elevation) +\n  tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend(\"Elevation (m)\"))+   \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\n  \n\nmap2 &lt;- tm_shape(zion_land) +\n  tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend(\"Land cover\"))+\n      tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\n\ntmap_arrange(map1, map2, nrow = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SpatRaster class can also handle multiple “layers”. Layers can store different variables for the same region in one object. This is similar to attributes (or columns) in data.frames. Later in the course when we discuss multispectral data, we’ll learn more about why remotely-sensed data will often contain multiple “bands” or layers.\nAs an example, we’ll load a dataset from spDataLarge containing the four bands of the Landsat 8 image for Zion National Park.\n\nlandsat &lt;- rast(system.file(\"raster/landsat.tif\", package = \"spDataLarge\"))\n\nnlyr(landsat) # test number of layers in raster object\n\n[1] 4\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(landsat) +\n  tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend(\"Unscaled reflectance\"),\n            col.free = FALSE )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can subset layers using either the layer number or name:\n\nlandsat3 &lt;- subset(landsat, 3)\nlandsat4 &lt;- subset(landsat, \"landsat_4\")\n\nWe can combine SpatRaster objects into one, using c():\n\nlandsat34 &lt;- c(landsat3, landsat4)\n\n\n\nMerging Rasters\nIn some cases, data for a region will be stored in multiple, contiguous files. To use them as a single raster, we need to merge them.\nIn this example, we download elevation data for Austria and Switzerland and merge the two rasters into one.\n\naustria &lt;- geodata::elevation_30s(country = \"AUT\", path = tempdir())\nswitzerland &lt;- geodata::elevation_30s(country = \"CHE\", path = tempdir())\n\nmerged &lt;- merge(austria, switzerland)\n\n\n\nCode\nmap1 &lt;- tm_shape(austria) +\n  tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend( \"Elevation (m)\")) +\n  tm_title(text = \"Austria\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\n  \nmap2 &lt;- tm_shape(switzerland) +\n  tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend( \"Elevation (m)\")) +\n  tm_title(text = \"Switzerland\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\n\nmap3 &lt;- tm_shape(merged) +\n tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend( \"Elevation (m)\")) +\n  tm_title(text = \"Merged\") +\n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\n  \ntmap_arrange(map1, map2, map3, nrow = 1)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInspecting raster objects\nWe can get info on raster values just by typing the name or using the summary function.\n\nsummary(zion_elevation)\n\nWarning: [summary] used a sample\n\n\n      srtm     \n Min.   :1024  \n 1st Qu.:1535  \n Median :1836  \n Mean   :1843  \n 3rd Qu.:2114  \n Max.   :2892  \n\n\nWe can get global summaries, such as standard deviation.\n\nglobal(zion_elevation, sd)\n\n           sd\nsrtm 416.6776\n\n\nOr we can use freq() to get the counts with categories.\n\nfreq(zion_land)\n\n  layer      value  count\n1     1      Water   1209\n2     1  Developed  17517\n3     1     Barren 106070\n4     1     Forest 767537\n5     1  Shrubland 545771\n6     1 Herbaceous   4878\n7     1 Cultivated   8728\n8     1   Wetlands   6497\n\n\n\n\nIndexing\nWe can index rasters using row-column indexing or cell IDs.\n\n# row 1, column 1\nzion_elevation[1, 1]\n\n  srtm\n1 1728\n\n# cell ID 1\nzion_elevation[1]\n\n  srtm\n1 1728\n\n\nFor multi-layer rasters, subsetting returns the values in both layers.\n\nlandsat[1]\n\n  landsat_1 landsat_2 landsat_3 landsat_4\n1      9833      9579      9861     14114\n\n\nWe can also modify/overwrite cell values.\n\nzion_elevation[1, 1] &lt;- 0\nzion_elevation[1, 1]\n\n  srtm\n1    0\n\n\nReplacing values in multi-layer rasters requires a matrix with as many columns as layers and rows as replaceable cells.\n\nlandsat[1] &lt;- cbind(c(0), c(0),c(0), c(0))\nlandsat[1]\n\n  landsat_1 landsat_2 landsat_3 landsat_4\n1         0         0         0         0\n\n\nWe can also use a similar approach to replace values that we suspect are incorrect.\n\ntest_raster &lt;- zion_elevation\ntest_raster[test_raster &lt; 20] &lt;- NA"

In some cases, we might want the output to be the raster cells themselves.\nWe can do this use the “[” operator and setting “drop = FALSE”.\n\nzion_elevation_clip &lt;- zion_elevation[clip, drop = FALSE]\n\n\n\nCode\nmap1 &lt;- tm_shape(zion_elevation) +\n  tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Elevation (m)\"))+\n  tm_title(text = \"original\")+\n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\n\nmap2 &lt;- tm_shape(zion_elevation_clip) +\n  tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Elevation (m)\"))+\n  tm_title(text = \"clipped\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\n\n\ntmap_arrange(map1, map2, nrow = 1)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningWoops, is the clipped version really smaller?\n\n\n\nPlotting side-by-side, the clipped version appears to take up more space – does this mean the clipping didn’t work? How can we tell?\n\nVisually: If we look at the features represented, we can see that the clipped version doesn’t represent all the features present in the original version.\nQuantitatively: We can directly check whether the extents match using the ext() function!\n\n\nif(ext(zion_elevation) == ext(zion_elevation_clip)){\n  print(\"extents match\")\n} else{\n  print(\"extents do not match\")\n}\n\n[1] \"extents do not match\"\n\n\n\n\nIn the previous example, we subsetted the extent of the raster (removed cells). Another common use of spatial subsetting is to select cells based on their values. In this case we create a “masking” raster comprised of logicals or NAs that dictates the cells we would like to preserve.\n\n# create raster mask of the same resolution and extent\nrmask &lt;- zion_elevation\n\n# set all cells with elevation less than 2000 meters to NA\nrmask[rmask &lt; 2000] &lt;- NA\n \n# subset elevation raster based on mask\n\n# approach 1: bracket subsetting\nmasked1 &lt;- zion_elevation[rmask, drop = FALSE]   \n# approach 2: mask() function\nmasked2 &lt;- mask(zion_elevation, rmask)           \n\n\n\nCode\nmap1 &lt;- tm_shape(zion_elevation) +\n  tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Elevation (m)\"))+\n  tm_title(text = \"original\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\nmap2 &lt;- tm_shape(masked1) +\n  tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Elevation (m)\"))+\n  tm_title(text = \"bracket subsetting\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\nmap3 &lt;- tm_shape(masked2) +\n  tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Elevation (m)\"))+\n  tm_title(text = \"mask()\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\ntmap_arrange(map1, map2, map3, nrow = 1)"

    "text": "4. Map algebra\n“Map algebra” is the set of operations that modify or summarize raster cell values with reference to surrounding cells, zones, or statistical functions that apply to every cell. Map algebra is typically categorized into local, focal, and zonal operations.\n\nLocal operations\nLocal operations are computed on each cell individually. For example, we can use ordinary arithmetic or logical statements.\n\nzion_elevation + zion_elevation # doubles each cells' value\nzion_elevation^2 # raises each cells' value to the power of 2\nlog(zion_elevation) # takes the log of each cells' value\nzion_elevation &gt; 5 # determines whether each cell has a value greater than 5\n\nWe can also classify intervals of values into groups. For example, we could classify elevation into low, middle, and high elevation cells.\nFirst, we need to construct a reclassification matrix:\n\nThe first column corresponds to the lower end of the class\nThe second column corresponds to the upper end of the class\nThe third column corresponds to the new value for the specified ranges in columns 1 and 2\n\n\n# create reclassification matrix\nrcl &lt;- matrix(c(1000, 1500, 1, # group 1 ranges from 1000 - 1500 m\n                1500, 2000, 2, # group 2 ranges from 1500 - 2000 m\n                2000, 2500, 3, # group 3 ranges from 2000 - 2500 m\n                2500, 3000, 4), # group 4 ranges from 2500 - 3000 m\n                ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\n\n# use reclassification matrix to reclassify elevation raster\nreclassified &lt;- classify(zion_elevation, rcl = rcl)\n\n# change reclassified values into factors\nvalues(reclassified) &lt;- as.factor(values(reclassified))\n\n\n\nCode\nmap1 &lt;- tm_shape(zion_elevation) +\n  tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Elevation (m)\"))+\n  tm_title(text = \"original\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\n\nmap2 &lt;- tm_shape(reclassified) +\n  tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Elevation (m)\"))+\n  tm_title(text= \"reclassified\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\n\ntmap_arrange(map1, map2, nrow = 1) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more efficient processing, we can use a set of map algebra functions:\n\napp() applies a function to each cell of a raster to summarize the values of multiple layers into one layer\ntapp() is an extension of app() that allows us to apply on operation on a subset of layers\nlapp() allows us to apply a function to each cell using layers as arguments\n\nWe can use the lapp()function to compute the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). (More on this later in the quarter!) Let’s calculate NDVI for Zion National Park using multispectral satellite data.\nFirst, we need to define a function to calculate NDVI. Then, we can use lapp() to calculate NDVI in each raster cell. To do so, we just need the NIR and red bands.\n\n# define NDVI as the normalized difference between NIR and red bands\nndvi_fun &lt;- function(nir, red){\n  (nir - red) / (nir + red)\n}\n\n# apply NDVI function to Landsat bands 3 & 4\nndvi_rast &lt;- lapp(landsat[[c(4, 3)]], fun = ndvi_fun)\n\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(ndvi_rast) +\n  tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend(title = \"NDVI\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocal Operations\nLocal operations operate on one cell, though from multiple layers. Focal operations take into account a central (focal) cell and its neighbors. The neighborhood (or kernel, moving window, filter) can take any size or shape. A focal operation applies an aggregation function to all cells in the neighborhood and updates the value of the central cell before moving on to the next central cell.\nThe image below provides an example of using a moving window filter. The large orange square highlights the 8 cells that are considered “neighbors” to the central cell (value = 8). Using this approach, the value of the central cell will be updated to the minimum value of its neighboring cells (in this case 0). This process then repeats for each cell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeocomputation with R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipCritical thinking\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are the cells on the border in the filtered raster now have values of NA?\nThe cells along the border do not have a complete set of “neighbors”, therefore the filtering operation returns a NA.\n\n\n\nWe can use the focal() function to perform spatial filtering. We define the size, shape, and weights of the moving window using a matrix. In the following example we’ll find the minimum value in 9x9 cell neighborhoods.\n\nelevation_focal &lt;- focal(zion_elevation, \n                         w = matrix(1, nrow = 9, ncol = 9), # create moving window\n                         fun = min) # function to map new values\n\n\n\nCode\nmap1 &lt;- tm_shape(zion_elevation) +\n  tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Elevation (m)\"))+\n  tm_title(text = \"original\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\n\nmap2 &lt;- tm_shape(elevation_focal) +\n  tm_raster(col.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Elevation (m)\"))+\n  tm_title(text = \"aggregated\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\n\ntmap_arrange(map1, map2, nrow = 1) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipCritical thinking\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should we expect to observe in the output for this spatial filtering example?\n\nOverall, we see more lower values because we are finding the minimum value in each neighborhood\nThe output looks “grainier” because many cells have the same values as their neighbors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZonal Operations\nSimilar to focal operations, zonal operations apply an aggregation function to multiple cells. However, instead of applying operations to neighbors, zonal operations aggregate based on “zones”. Zones can are defined using a categorical raster and do not necessarily have to be neighbors\nFor example, we could find the average elevation for within the elevations zones we created.\n\nzonal(zion_elevation, reclassified, fun = \"mean\") %&gt;%\n  kable(col.names = c(\"Elevation zone\", \"Mean elevation (m)\")) %&gt;% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = \"striped\")\n\n\n\n\nElevation zone\nMean elevation (m)\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.000\n\n\n1\n1292.281\n\n\n2\n1771.967\n\n\n3\n2222.776\n\n\n4\n2640.340"

    "text": "2. Spatial subsetting (filtering)\nWhen working with tabular data, we have frequently found it useful to subset the data.frame we are working with based on some condition using dplyr::filter().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork by Allison Horst\n\nFor example, last week we saw how we could filter to countries whose average life expectancy is greater than 80 years old using the following code:\n\nworld %&gt;%\n  filter(lifeExp &gt;= 80)\n\nSimilarly, we might want to filter data based on its spatial relationships. In this case, we use spatial subsetting which is the process of converting a spatial object into a new object containing only the spatial features that relate in space to another object. This is analogous the attribute subsetting that we covered last week (example above).\n\nTopological relationships\nWhen filtering based on attributes, we use conditions (for example, lifeExp &gt;= 80). In spatial subsetting, we use the relationships of objects to each other in space (topological relationships). These relationships are based on mathematical relationships, but can be more easily understood from visualizing them. The figure below shows how each relationship is satisfied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeocomputation with R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipst_intersects() and st_disjoint()\n\n\n\nNote that st_intersects()is a “catch-all” that contains the following relationships:\n\nst_touches()\nst_overlaps()\nst_contains() and st_contains_properly()\nst_covers() and st_covered_by()\nst_within()\n\nst_disjoint() is the opposite of st_intersects()\n\n\n\n\nExamples\nThere are many ways to spatially subset in R, so we will explore a few.\nAs an example we’ll work with the following two datasets from the spData package:\n\nnz: polygons representing the 16 regions of New Zealand\nnz_height: top 101 heighest points in New Zealand\n\nWe’ll explore by trying to find all the high points in the region of Canterbury (shown in dark grey).\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(nz) +\n  tm_polygons() +\ntm_shape(canterbury) +\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"darkgrey\") +\ntm_shape(nz_height) +\n  tm_dots(fill = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBracket subsetting\nLike attribute subsetting, the command x[y, ] (equivalent to nz_height[canterbury, ]) subsets features of a target x using the contents of a source object y. Instead of y being a vector of class logical or integer, however, for spatial subsetting both x and y must be geographic objects. Specifically, objects used for spatial subsetting in this way must have the class sf or sfc: both nz and nz_height are geographic vector data frames and have the class sf, and the result of the operation returns another sf object representing the features in the target nz_height object that intersect with (in this case high points that are located within) the Canterbury region.\n\n# first filter to the region of Canterbury\ncanterbury &lt;- nz %&gt;%\n  filter(Name == \"Canterbury\")\n\n# subset nz_heights to just the features that intersect Canterbury\nc_height1 &lt;- nz_height[canterbury, ]\n\nBy default bracket subsetting will filter to features in x that intersect features in y. However, we can use other topological relationships by changing options.\n\nnz_height[canterbury, , op = st_disjoint]\n\n\n\nst_filter()\nThe sf package also includes the function st_filter() which is analogous to dplyr::filter(). Using st_filter() we can perform spatial subsetting in the same format as using dplyr commands. The .predicate = argument allows us to define which topological relationship we would like to filter by (e.g. st_intersects(), st_disjoint()).\nThe results from this method are the identical to the method above.\n\n# subset to the features in Cantebury\nc_height2 &lt;- nz_height %&gt;%\n  st_filter(y = canterbury, .predicate = st_intersects) # define the topological relationship\n\n\n\nTopological operators (st_intersects())\nThe previous two methods either by default or explicitly use the argument st_intersects. All topological relationships have their own topological operators which are functions that evaluate whether or not features meet the specified condition (e.g. st_intersects()). These operators can be used for spatial subsetting, but are more complicated to use.\nThe output of st_intersects() and other topological operators is a sparse geometry binary predicate list (yikes!) that’s a list that defines whether or not each feature in x intersects y.\nThis can be converted into logical vector of TRUE and FALSE values which can then be used for filtering.\n\n# sparse binary predicate list\nnz_height_sgbp &lt;- st_intersects(x = nz_height, y = canterbury)\nnz_height_sgbp\n\nSparse geometry binary predicate list of length 101, where the\npredicate was `intersects'\nfirst 10 elements:\n 1: (empty)\n 2: (empty)\n 3: (empty)\n 4: (empty)\n 5: 1\n 6: 1\n 7: 1\n 8: 1\n 9: 1\n 10: 1\n\n# convert to logical vector\nnz_height_logical &lt;- lengths(nz_height_sgbp) &gt; 0\n\n# filter based on logical vector\nc_height3 = nz_height[nz_height_logical, ]\n\nNow let’s plot results from all three methods to confirm they gave the same results.\n\n\nCode\nmap1 &lt;- tm_shape(nz) +\n  tm_polygons() +\n  tm_shape(canterbury) +\n  tm_fill(fill = \"darkgrey\") +\n  tm_shape(c_height1) +\n  tm_dots(fill = \"red\") +\n  tm_title(text = \"Bracket subsetting\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\nmap2 &lt;- tm_shape(nz) +\n  tm_polygons() +\n  tm_shape(canterbury) +\n  tm_fill(fill = \"darkgrey\") +\n  tm_shape(c_height1) +\n  tm_dots(fill = \"red\") +\n  tm_title(text = \"st_filter()\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\nmap3 &lt;- tm_shape(nz) +\n  tm_polygons() +\n  tm_shape(canterbury) +\n  tm_fill(fill = \"darkgrey\") +\n  tm_shape(c_height3) +\n  tm_dots(fill = \"red\") +\n  tm_title(text = \"st_intersects()\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\ntmap_arrange(map1, map2, map3, nrow = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance relationships\nThe topological relationships we have been discussing are all binary (features either intersect or don’t). In some cases, it might be helpful to subset based on a distance to a feature. In these cases we can use the st_is_within_distance() to filter features. By default st_is_within_distance() will return a sparse geometry binary predicate list as in st_intersects() above. Instead, we can return a logical by setting sparse = FALSE.\n\n# find heights within 1000 km of Canterbury\nnz_height_logical &lt;- st_is_within_distance(nz_height, canterbury,\n                      dist = units::set_units(1000, \"km\"), # set distance\n                      sparse = FALSE) # return logical vector instead\n\nc_height4 &lt;- nz_height[nz_height_logical, ] # filter based on logical\n\nNow, we should see points appear that do not intersect Caterbury, but are within 1000 km.\n\n\nCode\n# additional high points should appear\ntm_shape(nz) +\n  tm_polygons() +\n  tm_shape(canterbury) +\n  tm_fill(fill = \"darkgrey\") +\n  tm_shape(c_height4) +\n  tm_dots(fill = \"red\")"

We can left join the nz dataset (polygons of NZ’s regions) onto the nz_height dataset (points of highest points in the county).\n\nnz_height_left_join &lt;- st_join(nz_height, nz) %&gt;%\n  select(id = t50_fid, elevation, region = Name)\n\nhead(nz_height_left_join)\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 3 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 1204143 ymin: 5048309 xmax: 1389460 ymax: 5168749\nProjected CRS: NZGD2000 / New Zealand Transverse Mercator 2000\n       id elevation     region                geometry\n1 2353944      2723  Southland POINT (1204143 5049971)\n2 2354404      2820      Otago POINT (1234725 5048309)\n3 2354405      2830      Otago POINT (1235915 5048745)\n4 2369113      3033 West Coast POINT (1259702 5076570)\n5 2362630      2749 Canterbury POINT (1378170 5158491)\n6 2362814      2822 Canterbury POINT (1389460 5168749)\n\n\nNow we could use this data to summarize the number of highest point in each region!\n\nnz_height_left_join %&gt;%\n  group_by(region) %&gt;%\n  summarise(n_points = n()) %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry()\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  region            n_points\n* &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;int&gt;\n1 Canterbury              70\n2 Manawatu-Wanganui        2\n3 Marlborough              1\n4 Otago                    2\n5 Southland                1\n6 Waikato                  3\n7 West Coast              22\n\n\n\n\nDistance-based joins\nSimilar to filtering, in some cases we may want to join datasets based on their proximity. Let’s see an example!\nWe’ll use the following two datasets from the spData package:\n\ncycle_hire: points representing cycle hire points across London with information on number of bikes available\ncycle_hire_osm: dataset downloaded from OpenStreetMaps representing cycle hire points across London with information on the capacity of the hire point\n\nIn this example, we would like join the capacity attribute from the cycle_hire_osm dataset to the cycle_hire dataset. Unfortunately it appears that the points from the two datasets do not perfectly align.\n\n# check whether or not points overlap\nif(any(st_intersects(cycle_hire, cycle_hire_osm, sparse = FALSE)) == TRUE){\n  print(\"points overlap\")\n} else{\n  warning(\"points don't overlap\")\n}\n\nWarning: points don't overlap\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\n\ntm_shape(cycle_hire) +\n  tm_symbols(fill = \"red\" , fill_alpha = 0.2)+\ntm_shape(cycle_hire_osm) +\n  tm_symbols(fill = \"blue\", fill_alpha = 0.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can join by again using st_join(), but this time including a distance threshold using st_is_within_distance.\n\ncycle_hire_join &lt;- st_join(cycle_hire, cycle_hire_osm,\n                           st_is_within_distance,\n                           dist = units::set_units(20, \"m\")) %&gt;%\n                   select(id, capacity)\n\nhead(cycle_hire_join)\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -0.1975742 ymin: 51.49313 xmax: -0.08460569 ymax: 51.53006\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n  id capacity                     geometry\n1  1        9  POINT (-0.1099705 51.52916)\n2  2       27  POINT (-0.1975742 51.49961)\n3  3       NA POINT (-0.08460569 51.52128)\n4  4       NA  POINT (-0.1209737 51.53006)\n5  5       NA   POINT (-0.156876 51.49313)\n6  6        8  POINT (-0.1442289 51.51812)\n\n\nLet’s build some checks to diagnose the output.\n\nif(nrow(cycle_hire) == nrow(cycle_hire_join)){\n  print(\"join matches original data dimensions\")\n} else {\n  warning(\"join does not match orginal data dimensions\")\n  print(paste(\"cycle_hire has\", nrow(cycle_hire), \"rows\"))\n  print(paste(\"cycle_hire_join has\", nrow(cycle_hire_join), \"rows\"))\n}\n\nWarning: join does not match orginal data dimensions\n\n\n[1] \"cycle_hire has 742 rows\"\n[1] \"cycle_hire_join has 762 rows\"\n\n\nNote that the joined result has more rows than the target data. This is because some of the cycle hire stations in cycle_hire have multiple matches in cycle_hire_osm. Depending on your project, you would need to think about how to resolve this. In this case, we can aggregate the values for the overlapping points by taking the mean.\n\n# aggregate values for single points in cycle_hire\ncycle_hire_join &lt;- cycle_hire_join %&gt;%\n  group_by(id) %&gt;%\n  summarise(capacity = mean(capacity))\n\n# check results\nif(nrow(cycle_hire) == nrow(cycle_hire_join)){\n  print(\"join matches original data dimensions\")\n} else {\n  warning(\"join does not match orginal data dimensions\")\n  print(paste(\"cycle_hire has\", nrow(cycle_hire), \"rows\"))\n  print(paste(\"cycle_hire_join has\", nrow(cycle_hire_join), \"rows\"))\n}\n\n[1] \"join matches original data dimensions\"\n\n\n\n\n4. Spatial aggregation\nAs with aggregating attribute data, spatial data aggregation condenses data: outputs have few rows than inputs. Think about our friend group_by() %&gt;% summarise()! Spatial aggregation is the same.\nLet’s consider the example where we would like to make a map of the mean elevation of high points within each region of NZ. There are several ways to do this, but the first thing we should be thinking is that we will need to retain the geometry column of the NZ regions in order to make a map.\nThe first approach is by leveraging st_join() again. But in this example, we want the nz object to be the target to maintain the geometries we need.\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\nℹ tmap mode set to \"plot\".\n\nnz_elevation &lt;- st_join(x = nz, y = nz_height) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Name) %&gt;%\n  summarise(elevation = mean(elevation, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nThe second approah uses the aggregate() function. Although it doesn’t follow the dplyr piping convention we’re used to, aggregate() will come in handy later, so it’s nice to see how it works.\nThe syntax looks slightly different, in this case the argument x is the data we would like to aggregate (nz_height) and the by argument specifies the geometry that you would like to group by. The FUN argument defines the function that you would like to use to aggregate, in this case mean.\n\nnz_elevation &lt;- aggregate(x = nz_height, by = nz, FUN = mean)\n\n\n\nCode\nmap1 &lt;- tm_shape(nz_elevation) +\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"elevation\",\n              fill.legend= tm_legend(title = \"Mean elevation (meters)\")) +\n  tm_title(text = \"group_by()\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\nmap2 &lt;- tm_shape(nz_elevation) +\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"elevation\",\n              fill.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Mean elevation (meters)\")) +\n  tm_title(text = \"aggregate()\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\ntmap_arrange(map1, map2, nrow = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteJoining incongruent layers\n\n\n\nAn important consideration when aggregating spatial objects is that geometries are congruent, meaning aggregating zones align with the units being aggregating. This is often the case with administrative boundaries where units are sub-units of one another (e.g. countries &gt; states &gt; counties).\nHowever, in some cases the aggregating zones do not share common borders with the target. This is an issue because it’s not clear how to aggregate underlying data. Areal interpolation overcomes this issue by transferring values to another using algorithms, including simple area weighted approaches.\n\nincongruent &lt;- spData::incongruent\naggregating_zones &lt;- spData::aggregating_zones\n\ntm_shape(incongruent) +\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"lightblue\",\n              border.col = \"blue\") +\n  tm_shape(aggregating_zones) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n── tmap v3 code detected ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n\n[v3-&gt;v4] `tm_polygons()`: use 'fill' for the fill color of polygons/symbols\n(instead of 'col'), and 'col' for the outlines (instead of 'border.col').\nThis message is displayed once every 8 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe simplest useful method for this is area weighted spatial interpolation, which transfers values from the incongruent object to a new column in aggregating_zones in proportion with the area of overlap: the larger the spatial intersection between input and output features, the larger the corresponding value. This is implemented in st_interpolate_aw(), as demonstrated in the code chunk below.\n\n# select just the value to be aggregated\nincongruent_2 &lt;- incongruent %&gt;%\n  select(value)\n\n# use area-weighted interpolation to aggregrate the \"value\" attribute\naggregating_zones_area_weighted &lt;- st_interpolate_aw(incongruent_2, aggregating_zones, extensive = TRUE)\n\nWarning in st_interpolate_aw.sf(incongruent_2, aggregating_zones, extensive =\nTRUE): st_interpolate_aw assumes attributes are constant or uniform over areas\nof x\n\naggregating_zones_area_weighted$value\n\n[1] 19.61613 25.66872"

An alternative approach to finding items that are within a set distance would be to expand the geometry and then intersect with objects of interest. We can change the size of geometries by creating a “buffer” using st_buffer()\nIn this example, let’s create 5 km and 50 km buffers around the Seine.\n\nseine_buffer_5km &lt;- st_buffer(seine, dist = 5000)\nseine_buffer_50km = st_buffer(seine, dist = 50000)\n\n\n\nCode\nmap1 &lt;- tm_shape(seine_buffer_5km) +\n  tm_polygons() +\n  tm_shape(seine) +\n  tm_lines() +\n  tm_title(text = \"5km buffer\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\nmap2 &lt;- tm_shape(seine_buffer_50km) +\n  tm_polygons() +\n  tm_shape(seine) +\n  tm_lines() +\n  tm_title(text = \"50km buffer\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\ntmap_arrange(map1, map2, nrow = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Seine is actually comprised of multiple geometries.

Spatial clipping is a form of spatial subsetting that involves changes to the geometry columns of at least some of the affected features.\nClipping can only apply to features more complex than points: lines, polygons and their ‘multi’ equivalents.\nThere are several options for clipping geometries:\n\nst_intersection(x, y) - portion of x intersecting y\nst_difference(x, y) - portion of x not intersecting y\nst_difference(y, x) - portion of y not intersecting x\nst_union(x, y) - portion either in x or y\nst_sym_difference(x, y) - portions of x and y that do not intersect\n\nTo illustrate the concept, we will start with a simple example: two overlapping circles with a center point one unit away from each other and a radius of one.\n\nx &lt;- st_sfc(st_point(c(0, 1))) %&gt;%\n  st_buffer(dist = 1) %&gt;%\n  st_sf() \n\ny &lt;- st_sfc(st_point(c(1, 1))) %&gt;%\n  st_buffer(dist = 1) %&gt;%\n  st_sf()\n\nintersection &lt;- st_intersection(x, y) \ndifference_x_y &lt;- st_difference(x, y) \ndifference_y_x &lt;- st_difference(y, x)\nunion &lt;- st_union(x, y)\nsym_difference &lt;- st_sym_difference(x, y) \n\n\n\nCode\nx &lt;- x %&gt;% st_set_crs(4326)\ny &lt;- y %&gt;% st_set_crs(4326)\nbbox &lt;- st_union(x, y)\n\nmap1 &lt;- tm_shape(x, bbox = bbox) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"red\") +\n  tm_shape(y) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"blue\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\nmap2 &lt;- map1 +\n  tm_shape(intersection, bbox = bbox) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"purple\") +\n  tm_title(text = \"st_intersection()\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\nmap3 &lt;- map1 +\n  tm_shape(difference_x_y, bbox = bbox) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"purple\") +\n  tm_title(text = \"st_difference(x,y)\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\n\nmap4 &lt;- map1 +\n  tm_shape(difference_y_x, bbox = bbox) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"purple\") +\n  tm_title(text = \"st_difference(y,x)\")+\n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\nmap5 &lt;- map1 +\n  tm_shape(union, bbox = bbox) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"purple\") +\n  tm_title(text = \"st_union()\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\nmap6 &lt;- map1 +\n  tm_shape(sym_difference, bbox = bbox) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"purple\") +\n  tm_title(text = \"st_sym_diffference()\")+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\ntmap_arrange(map1, map2, map3, map4, map5, map6, nrow = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s see how we could use these updated geometries for filtering. Extending this simple example, we’ll create 100 random points. We want to find the points that intersect both x and y.

    "text": "3. Making life easier!\nWorking with, and especially plotting, complex spatial objects can become quite cumbersome. This section we’ll see a few ways to create and manipulate geometries to make them easier to work with.\n\nCentroids\nCentroids are basically the center of spatial objects. They can be a handy way to display summary statistics (or we might actually use them for analysis – e.g. to find the distance between polygons).\nThere are many ways to that we might want to define the “center” of an object, but the most common is the geographic centroid which is the center of mass of a spatial object. The geographic centroid can be found using st_centroid().\nSometimes the geographic centroid may fall outside of the boundaries of the object (picture the centroid of a doughnut!). While correct, it might be confusing on a map, so we can use st_point_on_surface() to ensure that the centroid is placed onto the object.\nLet’s inspect a few examples!\n\nnz_centroid &lt;- st_centroid(nz)\nseine_centroid &lt;- st_centroid(seine)\n\nnz_pos &lt;- st_point_on_surface(nz)\nseine_pos &lt;- st_point_on_surface(seine)\n\n\n\nCode\nmap1 &lt;- tm_shape(nz) +\n  tm_polygons() +\n  tm_shape(nz_centroid) +\n  tm_symbols(fill = \"red\", fill_alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_shape(nz_pos) +\n  tm_symbols(fill = \"blue\", fill_alpha = 0.5)+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\nmap2 &lt;- tm_shape(seine) +\n  tm_lines() +\n  tm_shape(seine_centroid) +\n  tm_symbols(fill = \"red\", fill_alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_shape(seine_pos) +\n  tm_symbols(fill = \"blue\", fill_alpha = 0.5)+ \n  tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0))\n\ntmap_arrange(map1, map2, nrow = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimplification\nWe may also want to simplify a geometry to make it easier to plot or take up less storage.

    "text": "2. Simple features in sf\nSimple features is a hierarchical data model that represents a wide range of geometry types. The sf package can represent all common vector geometry types:\n\npoints\nlines\npolygons\nand their respective ‘multi’ versions\n\nsfprovides the same functionality that the sp, rgdal, and rgeos packages provided, but is more intuitive because it builds on the tidy data model and works well with the tidyverse. sf represents spatial objects as “simple feature” objects by storing them as a data frame with the geographic data stored in a special column (usually named geom or geometry).\n\nSimple features from scratch\nLet’s start by looking at how we can construct a sf object. Typically we will load sf objects by reading in data. However, it can be helpful to see how sf objects are created from scratch.\nFirst, we create a geometry for London by supplying a point and coordinate reference system.\n\n# create st_point with longitude and latitude for London\n# simple feature geometry\nlondon_point &lt;- st_point(c(0.1, 51.5))\n\n# add coordinate reference system\n# simple feature collection\nlondon_geom &lt;- st_sfc(london_point, crs = 4326)\n\nThen, we supply some non-geographic attributes by creating a data frame with attributes about London.\n\n# create data frame of attributes about London\nlondon_attrib &lt;- data.frame(\n  name = \"London\",\n  temperature = 25,\n  date = as.Date(\"2017-06-21\")\n  )\n\nAnd we attach the simple feature collection and data frame to create a sf object. Check out the class of the new object we created.\n\n# combine geometry and data frame\n# simple feature object\nlondon_sf &lt;- st_sf(london_attrib, geometry = london_geom)\n\n# check class\nclass(london_sf)\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"data.frame\"\n\n\nWe can also check out what the CRS looks like:\n\nst_crs(london_sf)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: EPSG:4326 \n  wkt:\nGEOGCRS[\"WGS 84\",\n    ENSEMBLE[\"World Geodetic System 1984 ensemble\",\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (Transit)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G730)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G873)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1150)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1674)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1762)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G2139)\"],\n        MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G2296)\"],\n        ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n        ENSEMBLEACCURACY[2.0]],\n    PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n        ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    CS[ellipsoidal,2],\n        AXIS[\"geodetic latitude (Lat)\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        AXIS[\"geodetic longitude (Lon)\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    USAGE[\n        SCOPE[\"Horizontal component of 3D system.\"],\n        AREA[\"World.\"],\n        BBOX[-90,-180,90,180]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",4326]]\n\nst_crs(london_sf)$IsGeographic\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nst_crs(london_sf)$proj4string\n\n[1] \"+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\"\n\n\n\n\nExisting sf object\nNow let’s look at an existing sf object representing countries of the world:\n\nworld &lt;- spData::world\nclass(world)\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\ndim(world)\n\n[1] 177  11\n\nnames(world)\n\n [1] \"iso_a2\"    \"name_long\" \"continent\" \"region_un\" \"subregion\" \"type\"     \n [7] \"area_km2\"  \"pop\"       \"lifeExp\"   \"gdpPercap\" \"geom\"     \n\n\nWe can see that this object contains both spatial data (geom column) and attributes about those geometries.

For example, dplyr’s select() function won’t get rid of it.\n\nworld_df &lt;- world %&gt;%\n  select(-geom) #doesn't actually remove the geom column\n\ncolnames(world_df) # geom still shows up as a column\n\n [1] \"iso_a2\"    \"name_long\" \"continent\" \"region_un\" \"subregion\" \"type\"     \n [7] \"area_km2\"  \"pop\"       \"lifeExp\"   \"gdpPercap\" \"geom\"     \n\n\nTo drop the geom column and convert this sf object into a data frame, we need to drop the geometry column using the st_drop_geometry().\n\nworld_df &lt;- st_drop_geometry(world)\nclass(world_df)\n\n[1] \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\nnames(world_df)\n\n [1] \"iso_a2\"    \"name_long\" \"continent\" \"region_un\" \"subregion\" \"type\"     \n [7] \"area_km2\"  \"pop\"       \"lifeExp\"   \"gdpPercap\"\n\nncol(world)\n\n[1] 11\n\nncol(world_df)\n\n[1] 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipsf syntax\n\n\n\nNote that all functions in the sf package start with the prefix st_ NOT sf_. Why? st_ stands for “spatiotemporal” as in data that varies in space and time."

To display 3D data in 2D, we use projections. Which projection you use can have big implications for how you display information.\nTo the projection of our data, we could:\n\nreproject the underlying data\nor in tmap we can specify the projection we want the map to use\n\nLet’s compare global maps using two different projections:\n\nEqual Earth is an equal-area pseudocylindrical projection (EPSG 8857)\nMercator is a conformal cylindrical map that preserves angles (EPSG 3395)\n\n\ntm_shape(world, crs = 8857) +\n  tm_fill(fill = \"area_km2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(world, crs = 3395) +\n  tm_fill(fill = \"area_km2\")"

    "text": "Background\nPresent-day environmental justice may reflect legacies of injustice in the past. The United States has a long history of racial segregation which is still visible. During the 1930’s the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC), as part of the New Deal, rated neighborhoods based on their perceived safety for real estate investment. Their ranking system, (A (green), B (blue), C (yellow), D (red)) was then used to block access to loans for home ownership. Colloquially known as “redlining”, this practice has had widely-documented consequences not only for community wealth, but also health.1 Redlined neighborhoods have less greenery2 and are hotter than other neighborhoods.3\nCheck out coverage by the New York Times.\nA recent study found that redlining has not only affected the environments communities are exposed to, it has also shaped our observations of biodiversity.4 Community or citizen science, whereby individuals share observations of species, is generating an enormous volume of data. Ellis-Soto and co-authors found that redlined neighborhoods remain the most undersampled areas across 195 US cities. This gap is highly concerning, because conservation decisions are made based on these data.\nCheck out coverage by EOS."

This tool is no longer operating, but you can find an unofficial version of it here\nAccording to the former US EPA website:\nThe tool, when in existence, was intended to support research and policy goals. It was shared with the public to achieve the following:\n\n\nto be more transparent about how we consider environmental justice in our work,\n\nto assist our stakeholders in making informed decisions about pursuing environmental justice and,\n\nto create a common starting point between the agency and the public when looking at issues related to environmental justice.\n\n\nEJScreen provided on environmental and demographic information for the US at the Census tract and block group levels.

For example, “I’m trying to do this…” or “I’m working on the task where we do this…”\nShare the specific challenge. “I’m specifically trying to [insert function / package] to do this thing.”\nShare what happens and what you’ve learned. “I repeatedly get an error message that says [this]. I’ve tried [this] and [this]”\nShow your code ideally with a reprex that they can run / test.\nValue and expect the Socratic method, especially in classes and workshops – our goal is to provide critical thinking that is transferable, not just to provide a quick fix for a single error."

    "text": "Exploring environmental (in)justice\nAs many of us are aware, environmental degradation, pollution, and hazards is not felt equally by all people. Environmental justice has many definitions, but the United States Environmental Protection Agency defines it as follows:\n\n“Environmental justice” means the just treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of income, race, color, national origin, Tribal affiliation, or disability, in agency decision-making and other Federal activities that affect human health and the environment so that people:\n\nare fully protected from disproportionate and adverse human health and environmental effects (including risks) and hazards, including those related to climate change, the cumulative impacts of environmental and other burdens, and the legacy of racism or other structural or systemic barriers; and\nhave equitable access to a healthy, sustainable, and resilient environment in which to live, play, work, learn, grow, worship, and engage in cultural and subsistence practices\n\n\nFor far too long, environmental inequities have been invisible, and thus ignored. Mapping environmental inequities can be a powerful tool for revealing injustices. We will be working with data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s previous EJScreen: Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool.\nThe tool, when in existence, was intended to support research and policy goals. It was shared with the public to achieve the following:\n\n\nto be more transparent about how we consider environmental justice in our work,\n\nto assist our stakeholders in making informed decisions about pursuing environmental justice and,\n\nto create a common starting point between the agency and the public when looking at issues related to environmental justice.\n\n\nWhile this tool is no longer available, an unofficial version of the tool can be found here.\n\nDescription\nFor this assignment, you will explore an environmental justice topic of your choosing. You should select a region, community, or environmental issue that matters to you.\nYou must complete the following:\n\ncreate two maps that communicate an environmental justice issue\nwrite a brief paragraph explaining what your maps communicate\n\n\n\nData details\nEJScreen provides on environmental and demographic information for the US at the Census tract and block group levels. You will be working with data at the block group level that has been downloaded from the EPA site.

In particular, you will use the VNP46A1 to detect differences in night lights before and after the storm to identify areas that lost electric power.\nTo determine the number of homes that lost power, you link (spatially join) these areas with OpenStreetMap data on buildings and roads.\nTo investigate potential socioeconomic factors that influenced recovery, you will link your analysis with data from the US Census Bureau."

    "text": "Data details\n\nNight lights\nUse NASA’s Worldview to explore the data around the day of the storm. There are several days with too much cloud cover to be useful, but 2021-02-07 and 2021-02-16 provide two clear, contrasting images to visualize the extent of the power outage in Texas.\nVIIRS data is distributed through NASA’s Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC). Many NASA Earth data products are distributed in 10x10 degree tiles in sinusoidal equal-area projection. Tiles are identified by their horizontal and vertical position in the grid. Houston lies on the border of tiles h08v05 and h08v06. We therefore need to download two tiles per date.\nAs you’re learning in EDS 220, accessing, downloading, and preparing remote sensing data is a skill in it’s own right! To prevent this assignment from being a large data wrangling challenge, we have downloaded and prepped the following files for you to work with, stored in the VNP46A1 folder.\n\nData files:\n\nVNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif: tile h08v05, collected on 2021-02-07\n\nVNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif: tile h08v06, collected on 2021-02-07\n\nVNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif: tile h08v05, collected on 2021-02-16\n\nVNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif: tile h08v06, collected on 2021-02-16\n\n\n\nRoads\nData file: gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg Typically highways account for a large portion of the night lights observable from space (see Google’s Earth at Night). To minimize falsely identifying areas with reduced traffic as areas without power, we will ignore areas near highways.\nOpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project which creates publicly available geographic data of the world. Ingesting this data into a database where it can be subsetted and processed is a large undertaking. Fortunately, third party companies redistribute OSM data. We used Geofabrik’s download sites to retrieve a shapefile of all highways in Texas and prepared a Geopackage (.gpkg file) containing just the subset of roads that intersect the Houston metropolitan area. \n\n\nHouses\nData file: gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg\nWe can also obtain building data from OpenStreetMap. We again downloaded from Geofabrick and prepared a GeoPackage containing only houses in the Houston metropolitan area.\n\n\n\nSocioeconomic\nWe cannot readily get socioeconomic information for every home, so instead we obtained data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey for census tracts in 2019. The folder ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48.gdb is an ArcGIS “file geodatabase”, a multi-file proprietary format that’s roughly analogous to a GeoPackage file.\n\nYou can use st_layers() to explore the contents of the geodatabase. Each layer contains a subset of the fields documents in the ACS metadata.\n\nThe geodatabase contains a layer holding the geometry information (ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS), separate from the layers holding the ACS attributes. You have to combine the geometry with the attributes to get a feature layer that sf can use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMake sure to check that these datasets have the same coordinate reference systems! If not, transform them to match."

Therefore, you should excluded any locations within 200 meters of all highways in the Houston area.\n\nidentify areas within 200m of all highways\n\nhint: you may need to use st_union\n\nfind areas that experienced blackouts that are further than 200m from a highway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe roads geopackage includes data on roads other than highways. However, we can avoid reading in data we don’t need by taking advantage of st_read’s ability to subset using a SQL query.\nBelow is a SQL query that can be used as an argument in st_read:\n\n\"SELECT * FROM gis_osm_roads_free_1 WHERE fclass='motorway'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the number of homes likely impacted by blackouts\n\nidentify homes that overlap with areas that experienced blackouts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe buildings geopackage includes data on many types of buildings. As with the roads data, we can avoid reading in data we don’t need.\nBelow is a SQL query that can be used as an argument in st_read:\n\n\"SELECT *\nFROM gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1`\nWHERE (type IS NULL AND name IS NULL)`\nOR type in ('residential', 'apartments', 'house', 'static_caravan', 'detached')\""

Because we’re performing the same operations over and over again, this is a good opportunity to generalize our workflow into a function!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhen should I create a function?\n\n\n\nThere are lots and lots of reasons to create a function! The biggest clue that you should consider creating one is if you have several lines of code duplicated.\n\n\nLet’s start over and see how we could do this more efficiently.\nWe’ll clear our environment and redefine our function for NDVI:\n\nrm(list = ls())  \nndvi_fun &lt;- function(nir, red){\n  (nir - red) / (nir + red)\n}\n\nNext, let’s first sketch out what operations we want to perform so we can figure out what our function needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningDon’t run this code!\n\n\n\nBefore diving into the detailed nuances of your function, it’s helpful to start by outlining the major steps you want your function to perform using pseudo-code.\n\n\n\n# NOTE: this code is not meant to run! \n# we're just outlining the function we want to create\n\ncreate_ndvi_layer &lt;- function(){\n  # step 1: read scene\n  landsat &lt;- rast(file)\n  # step 2: rename layer\n  names(landsat) &lt;- c(\"blue\", \"green\", \"red\", \"NIR\", \"SWIR1\", \"SWIR2\")\n  # step 3: compute NDVI\n  ndvi &lt;- lapp(landsat[[c(4, 3)]], fun = ndvi_fun)\n  return(ndvi)\n}\n\n# What do we notice as what we need to pass into our function?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTurning pseudo-code into real code\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve written out the pseudo-code, we need to ask ourselves what argument(s) we would need to pass into our function to set off the process.\nIn this case, the first operation needs a file name to read in. So, we now we need to figure out a way to come up with a set of file names to iterate through.\n\n\nWe want a list of the scenes so that we can tell our function to compute NDVI for each. To do that we look in our data folder for the relevant file. To do so, we want to do the following:\n\nAsk for the names of all the files in the data folder\nSet the pattern option to return the names that end in .tif (the file extension for the Landsat scenes)\nSet the full.names option returns the full file path for each scene\n\n\nfiles &lt;- list.files(\n  here(\"data\"), pattern = \"*.tif\", \n  full.names = TRUE)\n\nNow let’s update our function to work with list of file names we created:\n\nPass function a number that will correspond to the index in the list of file names\n\n\ncreate_ndvi_layer &lt;- function(i){\n  landsat &lt;- rast(files[i])\n  names(landsat) &lt;- c(\"blue\", \"green\", \"red\", \"NIR\", \"SWIR1\", \"SWIR2\")\n  ndvi &lt;- lapp(landsat[[c(4, 3)]], fun = ndvi_fun)\n  return(ndvi)\n}\n\nLet’s test our function by asking it to read in the first file:\n\ntest &lt;- create_ndvi_layer(1)\n\nNow we can use our function to create a NDVI layer for each scene and stack them into a single rasterstack. And then update layer names to match date:\n\nall_ndvi &lt;- c(create_ndvi_layer(1), \n              create_ndvi_layer(2), \n              create_ndvi_layer(3), \n              create_ndvi_layer(4), \n              create_ndvi_layer(5), \n              create_ndvi_layer(6), \n              create_ndvi_layer(7), \n              create_ndvi_layer(8))\n\nnames(all_ndvi) &lt;- c(\"2018-06-12\", \n                    \"2018-08-15\", \n                    \"2018-10-18\", \n                    \"2018-11-03\", \n                    \"2019-01-22\", \n                    \"2019-02-23\", \n                    \"2019-04-12\", \n                    \"2019-07-01\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipCritical thinking\n\n\n\nIs there a way to improve this last step even further?

    "text": "3. Specifying spatial data\nSimilar to plotting in ggplot2, in order to plot spatial data, at least two aspects need to be specified:\n\nthe spatial data object to plot (similar to ggplot(data = ))\nand the plotting method (similar to geom_points())\n\nLet’s load three spatial data objects to plot:\n\na raster (more on this next week!) of elevations of the world\na vector dataset (again, more soon!) of country boundaries\na vector dataset of locations of major cities\n\n\n# raster of global elevations\nworld_elevation &lt;- read_stars(here(\"data\",\"week1\",\"worldelevation.tif\"))\n\n# country boundaries\nworld_vector &lt;- read_sf(here(\"data\",\"week1\",\"worldvector.gpkg\"))\n\n# major cities\nworld_cities &lt;- read_sf(here(\"data\",\"week1\",\"worldcities.gpkg\"))\n\n\nShapes and layers\nIn tmap, the spatial object to plot needs to be defined within the function tm_shape(). This is analogous to defining the data frame to plot in ggplot2 using ggplot(data = ).\nLet’s start by plotting the countries of the world.\n\n# plotting a single spatial object\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) + # defines the spatial object to plot\n  tm_polygons() # defines how to plot the object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShapes hierarchy\nSimilar to ggplot2, we can plot multiple datasets by adding layers. When multiple spatial objects are being plotted, each has to be defined in a separate tm_shape() call.\nNow let’s plot the following two spatial objects:\n\ncountries of the world\nmajor cities of the world\n\nIn the next section we’ll unpack the difference between tm_polygons() and tm_dots(), but for now let’s just pay attention to the syntax of how we plot multiple spatial objects. Each spatial object needs to be specified using tm_shape() followed by a function for how to plot it.\n\n# plotting two spatial objects\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) + # defines the FIRST spatial object to plot\n  tm_polygons() + # defines how to plot the FIRST object\ntm_shape(world_cities) + # defines the SECOND objet to plot\n  tm_dots() # defines how to plot the SECOND object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, we’ve only tried plotting vector data (more on what this means next week!), but one of the major advantages of tmap is that it allows us to plot vector and raster on the same map.\nLet’s try on example of this by adding information on global elevations to our previous map.\n\n# plotting vector and raster spatial objects\n\ntm_shape(world_elevation) + # plot global elevations\n  tm_raster() + # tm_raster for raster data\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_borders() +\ntm_shape(world_cities) +\n  tm_dots() +\n  tm_text(\"name\")\n\n[scale] tm_raster:() the data variable assigned to 'col' contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0. Set 'midpoint = NA' in 'fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(&lt;HERE&gt;)' to use all visual values (e.g. colors)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to ggplot2 the order of the “layers” matters! The order in which datasets are plotted defines how they are layered (think of this is as adding layers of paint). Spatial objects have extra features which additionally change this behavior: spatial extent and projection. When creating maps with tmap, whichever dataset is used in the first tm_shape() call sets the spatial extent and projection (more details next week!) for the entire map.\nFor example, if we swapped the order of tm_shape() calls in the previous example, we’d end up with a different map.\n\ntm_shape(world_cities) + # plot world_cities first\n  tm_dots() +\n  tm_text(\"name\") +\ntm_shape(world_elevation) +\n  tm_raster() +\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_borders() \n\n[tip] Consider a suitable map projection, e.g. by adding `+ tm_crs(\"auto\")`.\n[scale] tm_raster:() the data variable assigned to 'col' contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0. Set 'midpoint = NA' in 'fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(&lt;HERE&gt;)' to use all visual values (e.g. colors)\n\nThis message is displayed once per session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes this can present sticky issues! Imagine the case where we want to use the spatial extent and projection from the world_cities data, but want it plotted on top of the other datasets. We can do this by changing the main shape using the is.main argument.\n\ntm_shape(world_elevation) + \n  tm_raster() + \ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_borders() +\ntm_shape(world_cities, is.main = TRUE) + # plot world_cities last, but set as main shape\n  tm_dots() +\n  tm_text(\"name\")\n\n[scale] tm_raster:() the data variable assigned to 'col' contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0. Set 'midpoint = NA' in 'fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(&lt;HERE&gt;)' to use all visual values (e.g. colors)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap extent\nOne thing to consider when making maps is what area we want to show on the map – the spatial extent of our map. This isn’t an issue when we want to map all of our data (spatial extent of our data matches our desired map extent). But often our data will represent a larger region than what we want to map.\nWe have two options:\n\nprocess our data to create a new spatial object for exactly what we want to map (fine, but annoying)\nchange the extent of a map\n\ntmap has a few options for changing the map extent. The first is by defining a bounding box that specifies the minimum and maximum coordinates in the x and y directions that we want to represent. The values need to be in the units of the original data or we can create a bounding box using st_bbox().\nFor example, let’s restrict our previous map to just Europe using a set of min/max values.\n\ntm_shape(world_elevation, bbox = c(-15, 35, 45, 65)) + # add bounding box to restrict extent\n  tm_raster() + \ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_borders() \n\n[scale] tm_raster:() the data variable assigned to 'col' contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0. Set 'midpoint = NA' in 'fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(&lt;HERE&gt;)' to use all visual values (e.g. colors)\n\n\nWarning: Current projection unknown.

    "text": "4. Layers\nAgain following the syntax of ggplot2 which uses layers to plot data (e.g. geom_point()), tmap also uses layers! We’ve already used layers in our previous examples (e.g. tm_borders()), but now we’ll dig into them in more detail. All possible layer types can be found in the table below:\n\n\n\nMap layers.\n\n\nFunction\nElement\nGeometry\n\n\n\n\nBasic functions\n\n\ntm_polygons()\npolygons (borders and fill)\npolygons\n\n\ntm_symbols()\nsymbols\npoints, polygons, and lines\n\n\ntm_lines()\nlines\nlines\n\n\ntm_raster()\nraster\nraster\n\n\ntm_text()\ntext\npoints, polygons, and lines\n\n\ntm_basemap()\ntile\n\n\n\ntm_tiles()\ntile\n\n\n\nDerived functions\n\n\ntm_borders()\npolygons (borders)\npolygons\n\n\ntm_fill()\npolygons (fill)\npolygons\n\n\ntm_bubbles()\nbubbles\npoints, polygons, and lines\n\n\ntm_dots()\ndots\npoints, polygons, and lines\n\n\ntm_markers()\nmarker symbols\npoints, polygons, and lines\n\n\ntm_square()\nsquares\npoints, polygons, and lines\n\n\ntm_iso()\nlines with text labels\nlines\n\n\ntm_rgb()/tm_rgba()\nraster (RGB image)\nraster\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolygons\nThe main function to visualize polygons is tm_polygons(). By default, it plots the internal area of the polygon in light grey and the polygon borders in slightly darker grey.\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe modify the colors using the fill and col arguments and other arguments borrowed from ggplot2.\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"lightblue\",\n              col = \"black\",\n              lwd = 0.5,\n              lty = \"dashed\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, you may have noticed in the previous table that tm_polygons isn’t the only function we can use to plot polygon data. In fact, tm_polygons is a combination of two separate functions - tm_fill() and tm_borders().\nThe tm_borders() function plots just the borders and the tm_fill() function fills polygons with a fixed color or a color palette representing a selected variable.\n\n# plot just borders\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# fill polygons with fixed color\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_fill(fill = \"lightblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# fill polygons with a color palette representing a variable\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_fill(\"CO2_emissions\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningSyntax differences\n\n\n\nNote that to change the border color in tm_polygons() we used the fill argument, but in tm_borders() we used the col argument. This is necessary in tm_polygons() to differentiate between the settings for the polygons fill and borders.\n\n\n\n\nSymbols\nSymbols are a very flexible layer type. They typically represent point data, but can also be used for lines and polygons (in this case located at the centroid of each feature). Symbols are also highly flexible in how they can be visualized. They can show the values of a given variable by the color, size, and shape of the symbol.\ntm_symbols() is the main function in tmap to display and modify symbol elements. By default, this function draws a gray circle symbol with a black border for each element of an input feature.\n\ntm_shape(world_cities) +\n  tm_symbols()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_symbols() has a large number of arguments to flexibly adjust how elements are displayed. While this allows adjusting its results to almost any need, it also makes this function complicated. Therefore, four additional layers are implemented in tmap: tm_squares(), tm_bubbles(), tm_dots(), tm_markers(). All of them use tm_symbols(), but with different default values.\n\ntm_squares(): uses square symbols (shape = 22)\ntm_bubbles(): uses large circle symbols\ntm_dots(): uses small circle symbols (good for displaying many locations)\ntm_markers(): uses marker icons\n\n\ntm_shape(world_cities) +\n  tm_squares()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(world_cities) +\n  tm_bubbles()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(world_cities) +\n  tm_dots()"

    "section": "5. Visual variables",
    "text": "5. Visual variables\nFollowing ggplot2 yet again, tmap uses the basic visual variables of color, size, and shape to represent data. Which variables can be applied depends on the type of the map layer.\n\nSymbols: color, size, and shape\nLines: color and size\nPolygons: color\n\nThe type of data (quantitative or qualitative) also determines which visual variables can be used.\n\nColor: quantitative or qualitative\nSize: quantitative\nShape: qualitative\n\n\nColor\ntmap uses the many ways that colors can be specified in R:\n\nbuilt-in color names (e.g. “red”)\nhexadecimal (e.g. #00FF00)\npalettes\n\nThere are dozens of packages that contain hundreds of color palettes. The most popular are RColorBrewer and viridis. By default, tmap attempts to identify the type of the data being plotted and selects on of the built-in palettes.\ntmap offers three main ways to specify color palettes using the palette argument:\n\na vector of colors\na palette function\none of the built-in names\n\nA vector of colors can be specified by name or hexidecimal. Importantly, the number of colors provided does not need to match the number of colors in the map legend. tmap automatically interpolates new colors in the case when a smaller number of colors is provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipUpdating legend titles\n\n\n\nJust like updating axis labels, we always need to update legend titles. In tmap we can do that by updating the fill.legend argument in the attribute layer.\n\n\nHow would I update the legend to be on the right side of my plot instead of beneath? If you aren’t sure, check the documentation!\n\n# vector of colors\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"life_expectancy\", \n              fill.scale = tm_scale(values = c(\"yellow\", \"darkgreen\")),\n              fill.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Life Expectancy (years)\", \n                                      position = tm_pos_out(\"right\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother approach is to provide the output of a palette function. When using a palette function, you can specify the number of colors to use. Below we use the viridis palette from the viridisLite package.\n\n#install.packages(\"viridisLite\")\nlibrary(viridisLite)\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"life_expectancy\", \n              fill.scale = tm_scale(values =  viridis(8)),\n              fill.legend = tm_legend(title  = \"Life Expectancy (years)\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the last approach is to use the name of one of the built-in color palettes.\n\n# built-in color palette\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"life_expectancy\", \n              fill.scale = tm_scale(values = \"brewer.yl_gn\"),\n              fill.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Life Expectancy (years)\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize\nSizes can be used for points, lines (line widths), or text to represent quantitative (numerical) variables. By default, tmap represents points, lines, or text objects as the same size. The size of objects can be changed by using the size argument.\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"lightblue\") +\ntm_shape(world_cities) +\n  tm_symbols(size = \"pop2020\",\n             size.legend = tm_legend(orientation = \"portrait\"))"

This is analogous to defining the data frame to plot in ggplot2 using ggplot(data = ) + geom_point().\nLet’s start by plotting the countries of the world.\n\n# plotting a single spatial object\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) + # defines the spatial object to plot\n  tm_polygons() # defines how to plot the object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShapes hierarchy\nSimilar to ggplot2, we can plot multiple datasets by adding layers. When multiple spatial objects are being plotted, each has to be defined in a separate tm_shape() call.\nNow let’s plot the following two spatial objects:\n\ncountries of the world\nmajor cities of the world\n\nIn the next section we’ll unpack the difference between tm_polygons() and tm_dots(), but for now let’s just pay attention to the syntax of how we plot multiple spatial objects. Each spatial object needs to be specified using tm_shape() followed by a function for how to plot it.\n\n# plotting two spatial objects\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) + # defines the FIRST spatial object to plot\n  tm_polygons() + # defines how to plot the FIRST object\ntm_shape(world_cities) + # defines the SECOND objet to plot\n  tm_dots() # defines how to plot the SECOND object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote Can also use tm_symbols and specify the shape number - ex. + tm_symbols(shape = 22)\nSo far, we’ve only tried plotting vector data (more on what this means next week!), but one of the major advantages of tmap is that it allows us to plot vector and raster on the same map.\nLet’s try on example of this by adding information on global elevations to our previous map.\n\n# plotting vector and raster spatial objects\n\ntm_shape(world_elevation) + # plot global elevations\n  tm_raster() + # tm_raster for raster data\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_borders() +\ntm_shape(world_cities) +\n  tm_dots() +\n  tm_text(\"name\")\n\n[scale] tm_raster:() the data variable assigned to 'col' contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0. Set 'midpoint = NA' in 'fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(&lt;HERE&gt;)' to use all visual values (e.g. colors)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Could add size = 0.7, col = \"red\" inside tm_text as well to make it look a bit better.\nSimilar to ggplot2 the order of the “layers” matters! The order in which datasets are plotted defines how they are layered (think of this is as adding layers of paint). Spatial objects have extra features which additionally change this behavior: spatial extent and projection. When creating maps with tmap, whichever dataset is used in the first tm_shape() call sets the spatial extent and projection (more details next week!) for the entire map.\nFor example, if we swapped the order of tm_shape() calls in the previous example, we’d end up with a different map.\n\ntm_shape(world_cities) + # plot world_cities first\n  tm_dots() +\n  tm_text(\"name\") +\ntm_shape(world_elevation) +\n  tm_raster() +\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_borders() \n\n[tip] Consider a suitable map projection, e.g. by adding `+ tm_crs(\"auto\")`.\n[scale] tm_raster:() the data variable assigned to 'col' contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0. Set 'midpoint = NA' in 'fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(&lt;HERE&gt;)' to use all visual values (e.g. colors)\n\nThis message is displayed once per session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes this can present sticky issues! Imagine the case where we want to use the spatial extent and projection from the world_cities data, but want it plotted on top of the other datasets. We can do this by changing the main shape using the is.main argument.\n\ntm_shape(world_elevation) + \n  tm_raster() + \ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_borders() +\ntm_shape(world_cities, is.main = TRUE) + # plot world_cities last, but set as main shape\n  tm_dots() +\n  tm_text(\"name\")\n\n[scale] tm_raster:() the data variable assigned to 'col' contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0. Set 'midpoint = NA' in 'fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(&lt;HERE&gt;)' to use all visual values (e.g. colors)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap extent\nOne thing to consider when making maps is what area we want to show on the map – the spatial extent of our map. This isn’t an issue when we want to map all of our data (spatial extent of our data matches our desired map extent). But often our data will represent a larger region than what we want to map.\nWe have two options:\n\nprocess our data to create a new spatial object for exactly what we want to map (fine, but annoying)\nchange the extent of a map\n\ntmap has a few options for changing the map extent. The first is by defining a bounding box that specifies the minimum and maximum coordinates in the x and y directions that we want to represent. The values need to be in the units of the original data or we can create a bounding box using st_bbox().\nFor example, let’s restrict our previous map to just Europe using a set of min/max values.\n\ntm_shape(world_elevation, bbox = c(-15, 35, 45, 65)) + # add bounding box to restrict extent\n  tm_raster() + \ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_borders() \n\n[scale] tm_raster:() the data variable assigned to 'col' contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0. Set 'midpoint = NA' in 'fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(&lt;HERE&gt;)' to use all visual values (e.g. colors)\n\n\nWarning: Current projection unknown. Long lat coordinates (wgs84) assumed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: bbox coordinates should be in whatever your crs is. In our case, it is WGS84, so it is in lat long coordinates\nbbox = (xmin (west), ymin (south), xmax (east), ymax (north))\nWe can also restrict the extent of the map using the extent of a dataset. For example, we can restrict the map using the extent of the world_cities data.\n\ntm_shape(world_elevation, bbox = world_cities) + # bounding box = extent of world_cities\n  tm_raster() + \ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_borders() \n\n[scale] tm_raster:() the data variable assigned to 'col' contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0. Set 'midpoint = NA' in 'fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(&lt;HERE&gt;)' to use all visual values (e.g. colors)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipBonus Tip\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also restrict the map extent using an OpenStreetMap tool called Nominatim to automatically generate minimum and maximum coordinates in the x and y directions based on the provided query.\n\ntm_shape(world_elevation, bbox = \"Europe\") + # query the region of Europe\n  tm_raster(col.scale = tm_scale(values = terrain.colors(8)))"

    "text": "4. Layers\nAgain following the syntax of ggplot2 which uses layers to plot data (e.g. geom_point()), tmap also uses layers! We’ve already used layers in our previous examples (e.g. tm_borders()), but now we’ll dig into them in more detail. All possible layer types can be found in the table below:\n\n\n\nMap layers.\n\n\nFunction\nElement\nGeometry\n\n\n\n\nBasic functions\n\n\ntm_polygons()\npolygons (borders and fill)\npolygons\n\n\ntm_symbols()\nsymbols\npoints, polygons, and lines\n\n\ntm_lines()\nlines\nlines\n\n\ntm_raster()\nraster\nraster\n\n\ntm_text()\ntext\npoints, polygons, and lines\n\n\ntm_basemap()\ntile\n\n\n\ntm_tiles()\ntile\n\n\n\nDerived functions\n\n\ntm_borders()\npolygons (borders)\npolygons\n\n\ntm_fill()\npolygons (fill)\npolygons\n\n\ntm_bubbles()\nbubbles\npoints, polygons, and lines\n\n\ntm_dots()\ndots\npoints, polygons, and lines\n\n\ntm_markers()\nmarker symbols\npoints, polygons, and lines\n\n\ntm_square()\nsquares\npoints, polygons, and lines\n\n\ntm_iso()\nlines with text labels\nlines\n\n\ntm_rgb()/tm_rgba()\nraster (RGB image)\nraster\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolygons\nThe main function to visualize polygons is tm_polygons(). By default, it plots the internal area of the polygon in light grey and the polygon borders in slightly darker grey.\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe modify the colors using the fill and col arguments and other arguments borrowed from ggplot2.\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"lightblue\",\n              col = \"black\",\n              lwd = 0.5,\n              lty = \"dashed\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, you may have noticed in the previous table that tm_polygons isn’t the only function we can use to plot polygon data. In fact, tm_polygons is a combination of two separate functions - tm_fill() and tm_borders().\nThe tm_borders() function plots just the borders and the tm_fill() function fills polygons with a fixed color or a color palette representing a selected variable.\n\n# plot just borders\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# fill polygons with fixed color\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_fill(fill = \"lightblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# fill polygons with a color palette representing a variable\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_fill(\"CO2_emissions\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningSyntax differences\n\n\n\nNote that to change the border color in tm_polygons() we used the fill argument, but in tm_borders() we used the col argument. This is necessary in tm_polygons() to differentiate between the settings for the polygons fill and borders.\n\n\n\n\nSymbols\nSymbols are a very flexible layer type. They typically represent point data, but can also be used for lines and polygons (in this case located at the centroid of each feature). Symbols are also highly flexible in how they can be visualized. They can show the values of a given variable by the color, size, and shape of the symbol.\ntm_symbols() is the main function in tmap to display and modify symbol elements. By default, this function draws a gray circle symbol with a black border for each element of an input feature.\n\ntm_shape(world_cities) +\n  tm_symbols()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_symbols() has a large number of arguments to flexibly adjust how elements are displayed. While this allows adjusting its results to almost any need, it also makes this function complicated. Therefore, four additional layers are implemented in tmap: tm_squares(), tm_bubbles(), tm_dots(), tm_markers(). All of them use tm_symbols(), but with different default values.\n\ntm_squares(): uses square symbols (shape = 22)\ntm_bubbles(): uses large circle symbols\ntm_dots(): uses small circle symbols (good for displaying many locations)\ntm_markers(): uses marker icons\n\n\ntm_shape(world_cities) +\n  tm_squares()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(world_cities) +\n  tm_bubbles()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(world_cities) +\n  tm_dots()"

    "section": "5. Visual variables",
    "text": "5. Visual variables\nFollowing ggplot2 yet again, tmap uses the basic visual variables of color, size, and shape to represent data. Which variables can be applied depends on the type of the map layer.\n\nSymbols: color, size, and shape\nLines: color and size\nPolygons: color\n\nThe type of data (quantitative or qualitative) also determines which visual variables can be used.\n\nColor: quantitative or qualitative\nSize: quantitative\nShape: qualitative\n\n\nColor\ntmap uses the many ways that colors can be specified in R:\n\nbuilt-in color names (e.g. “red”)\nhexadecimal (e.g. #00FF00)\npalettes\n\nThere are dozens of packages that contain hundreds of color palettes. The most popular are RColorBrewer and viridis. By default, tmap attempts to identify the type of the data being plotted and selects on of the built-in palettes.\ntmap offers three main ways to specify color palettes using the palette argument:\n\na vector of colors\na palette function\none of the built-in names\n\nA vector of colors can be specified by name or hexidecimal. Importantly, the number of colors provided does not need to match the number of colors in the map legend. tmap automatically interpolates new colors in the case when a smaller number of colors is provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipUpdating legend titles\n\n\n\nJust like updating axis labels, we always need to update legend titles. In tmap we can do that by updating the fill.legend argument in the attribute layer.\n\n\n\n# vector of colors\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"life_expectancy\", \n              fill.scale = tm_scale(values = c(\"yellow\", \"darkgreen\")),\n              fill.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Life Expectancy (years)\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow would I update the legend to be on the right side of my plot instead of beneath? If you aren’t sure, check the documentation!\n\n# vector of colors\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"life_expectancy\", \n              fill.scale = tm_scale(values = c(\"yellow\", \"darkgreen\")),\n              fill.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Life Expectancy (years)\", \n                                      position = tm_pos_out(\"right\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother approach is to provide the output of a palette function. When using a palette function, you can specify the number of colors to use. Below we use the viridis palette from the viridisLite package.\n\n#install.packages(\"viridisLite\")\nlibrary(viridisLite)\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"life_expectancy\", \n              fill.scale = tm_scale(values =  viridis(8)),\n              fill.legend = tm_legend(title  = \"Life Expectancy (years)\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNotice how we picked 8 colors but only have 7 categories. Like mentioned above, the number of categories doesnt need to match the number of colors!\nFinally, the last approach is to use the name of one of the built-in color palettes.\n\n# built-in color palette\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"life_expectancy\", \n              fill.scale = tm_scale(values = \"brewer.yl_gn\"),\n              fill.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Life Expectancy (years)\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome other brewer options :YlOrBr(sequential), Pastel1 (diverging), Accent (qualitative)\n\n\nSize\nSizes can be used for points, lines (line widths), or text to represent quantitative (numerical) variables. By default, tmap represents points, lines, or text objects as the same size. The size of objects can be changed by using the size argument.\n\ntm_shape(world_vector) +\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"lightblue\") +\ntm_shape(world_cities) +\n  tm_symbols(size = \"pop2020\",\n             size.legend = tm_legend(orientation = \"portrait\"))"

    "section": "2. Rasterization",
    "text": "2. Rasterization\n“Rasterization” is the process of representing vector objects as raster objects. You might consider “rasterizing” vector data for the following reasons:\n\nto use in an analysis that benefits from raster operations (e.g. map algebra)\nstandardize with other data used in analysis\nsimplify data to reduce computational load\naggregated data to standard grid\n\nTo “rasterize” data using the {terra} package, we use the rasterize() function. The first two arguments define the following:\n\nx: vector object to be “rasterized”\ny: a ‘template’ raster object defining the extent, resolution, and CRS of the output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningDefining the template raster\n\n\n\nThe geographic resolution of the input raster has a major impact on the results.\n\nIf it is too low (cell size is too large), the result may miss the full geographic variability of the vector data\nIf it is too high (cell size is too small), computational times may be excessive\n\nThere are no simple rules to follow when deciding an appropriate geographic resolution, which is heavily dependent on the intended use of the results. Often the target resolution is imposed on the user, for example when the output of rasterization needs to be aligned to some other existing raster.\n\n\n\nLine and polygon rasterization\nThe simplest case of rasterization is simply converting the geometries of vector objects to raster objects. In this case, all we are hoping to do is indicate within each raster cell whether or not the vector object is present there.\nIn most cases, the purpose behind rasterizing vector object is to make it more directly comparable to data that is represented as raster objects. In that case, you want to use the raster object that you would like to compare to as the ‘template’ raster.\nLet’s check out how this works by investigating an example from Zion National Park\n\n# load Zion park boundary (vector object to rasterize)\nboundary &lt;- read_sf(system.file(\"vector/zion.gpkg\", package = \"spDataLarge\")) \n\n# load elevation raster to use as template raster object\nelevation &lt;- rast(system.file(\"raster/srtm.tif\", package = \"spDataLarge\"))\n\n# check and transform coordinate reference systems\nif(crs(elevation) == crs(boundary)) {\n  print(\"Coordinate reference systems match\")\n} else{\n  warning(\"Updating coordinate reference systems to match\")\n  # transform data to match\n  boundary &lt;- st_transform(boundary, st_crs(elevation))\n}\n\nWarning: Updating coordinate reference systems to match\n\n\nRasterization gives different results for polygon versus line vector objects.\n\nRasterized polygons: all grid cells intersecting polygon (including cells inside polygon)\nRasterized lines: grid cells intersecting line (excluding cells potentially enclose by line)\n\nLet’s check out whether or not the park boundary is represented as polygon or line. We can always inspect the geometry type of a vector object using sf::st_geometry_type().\n\nif(sf::st_geometry_type(boundary) == \"POLYGON\"){\n  print(\"polygon data\")\n} else {\n  print(\"not polygon data\")\n}\n\n[1] \"polygon data\"\n\n\nThe park boundary is a polygon, so let’s make a version that just represents the park border using a line geometry.\n\n# update park boundary object name to clarify that it's a polygon\npark_polygon &lt;- boundary\n\n# create line version park boundary\npark_border &lt;- boundary %&gt;%\n  sf::st_cast(., \"MULTILINESTRING\")\n\n\n\nCode\nmap1 &lt;- tm_shape(park_polygon) +\n  tm_polygons() +\n  tm_title(text = \"polygon\")\n\nmap2 &lt;- tm_shape(park_border) +\n  tm_lines() +\n  tm_title(text = \"line\")\n\ntmap_arrange(map1, map2, nrow = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can rasterize both the polygon and line representations of the park boundary.\n\npolygon_raster &lt;- terra::rasterize(park_polygon, elevation)\nborder_raster &lt;- terra::rasterize(park_border, elevation)\n\n\n\nCode\nmap1 &lt;- tm_shape(polygon_raster) +\n  tm_raster() +\n  tm_title(text = \"rasterized polygon\")+ \n  tm_layout(\n    legend.position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\")  \n  )\n\nmap2 &lt;- tm_shape(border_raster) +\n  tm_raster() +\n  tm_title(text = \"rasterized line\")+ \n  tm_layout(\n    legend.position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\")  \n  )\n\ntmap_arrange(map1, map2, nrow = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case where you are rasterizing without a pre-existing raster you would like to match to, you can create a template raster from scratch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipImpact of resolution\n\n\n\nUsing a custom template raster is a also a great way to explore how the resolution impacts the results of rasterization!\n\n\n\n# create low spatial resolution template raster\ntemplate_raster_low &lt;- terra::rast(ext(park_polygon), resolution = 0.05,\n                        crs = st_crs(park_polygon))\n\n# create high spatial resolution template raster\ntemplate_raster_high &lt;- terra::rast(ext(park_polygon), resolution = 0.01,\n                        crs = st_crs(park_polygon))\n\n# rasterize to low resolution template raster\npolygon_raster_low &lt;- terra::rasterize(park_polygon, template_raster_low)\n\n# rasterize to high resolution template raster\npolygon_raster_high &lt;- terra::rasterize(park_polygon, template_raster_high)\n\n\n\nCode\nmap1 &lt;- tm_shape(polygon_raster_low) +\n  tm_raster() +\n  tm_title(text = \"low resolution\")+ \n  tm_layout(\n    legend.position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\")  \n  )\n\nmap2 &lt;- tm_shape(polygon_raster_high) +\n  tm_raster() +\n  tm_title(text = \"high resolution\") + \n    tm_layout(\n    legend.position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\")  \n  )\n\ntmap_arrange(map1, map2, nrow = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRasterizing point data\nWhen working with point data, we can use the same process as with line and polygon data. However, in some cases we might want to perform more complex operations. Instead of simply indicating whether or not the vector object falls within each grid cell, we might want to count the number of points in each grid cell or even summarize the attributes of points within each cell.\nLet’s try an example using data on cycle hire points in London from {spData}.\n\n# define point data\ncycle_hire_osm &lt;- spData::cycle_hire_osm\n\n# transform to projected CRS\ncycle_hire_osm_projected = sf::st_transform(cycle_hire_osm, \"EPSG:27700\")\n\n# define raster template\ntemplate_raster &lt;- terra::rast(ext(cycle_hire_osm_projected), resolution = 1000,\n                       crs = crs(cycle_hire_osm_projected))\n\nIn the following code chunk we’ll perform three versions of rasterization to produce the following:\n\nraster representing the presence/absence of cycle hire points\nraster representing the number of cycle hire points\nraster representing the total capacity of cycle hire points\n\nTo represent the presence/absence of cycle hire points, we use the same procedure as before.\n\nch_raster1 &lt;- terra::rasterize(cycle_hire_osm_projected, template_raster)\n\nTo represent the number of cycle hire points, we use the fun argument which allows for various summarizing functions. Setting the argument fun = \"length\" will return a count of the number of points in each cell\n\nch_raster2 &lt;- rasterize(cycle_hire_osm_projected, template_raster, \n                       fun = \"length\")\n\nTo represent the total capacity of cycle hire points, we need to take the sum of each points’ capacity. We can do this by defining which field we would like to aggregate (in this case capacity) and what aggregating function we would like to use (in this case fun = sum).\n\nch_raster3 &lt;- rasterize(cycle_hire_osm_projected, template_raster, \n                       field = \"capacity\", fun = sum, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\n\nCode\nmap1 &lt;- tm_shape(cycle_hire_osm_projected) +\n  tm_symbols(fill  = \"capacity\") +\n  tm_title(text = \"original points\")+ \n    tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0), \n              legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\")  )\n\nmap2 &lt;- tm_shape(ch_raster1) +\n  tm_raster(col.legend= tm_legend(\"presence\")) +\n  tm_title(text = \"presence/absence\")+ \n    tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0), \n              legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\")  ) \n\nmap3 &lt;- tm_shape(ch_raster2) +\n  tm_raster(col.legend= tm_legend(\"Hire points (n)\")) +\n  tm_title(text = \"count of points\")+ \n    tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0), \n              legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"))\nmap4 &lt;- tm_shape(ch_raster3) +\n  tm_raster(col.legend= tm_legend(\"Capacity (n bikes)\")) +\n  tm_title(text = \"sum of capacity\")+ \n    tm_layout(meta.margins = c(.2, 0, 0, 0), \n              legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"))\n\ntmap_arrange(map1, map2, map3, map4, nrow = 2)"

    "text": "2. Raster cropping\nMany geographic data projects involve integrating data from many different sources, such as remote sensing images (rasters) and administrative boundaries (vectors). Often the extent of input raster datasets is larger than the area of interest. In this case, raster cropping and masking are useful for unifying the spatial extent of input data. Both operations reduce object memory use and associated computational resources for subsequent analysis steps and may be a necessary preprocessing step when creating attractive maps involving raster data.\nFirst, let’s crop the extent of the elevation raster to match the extent of Zion’s boundaries. Through this process, we eliminate grid cells that fall outside the extent of the park and reduce the size of the raster. To do so, we use the terra::crop() function.\n\n# crop raster to extent of vector object\nelevation_cropped &lt;- crop(elevation, boundary)\n\nBeyond matching the extent, we can also set the values of raster cells outside of the boundaries or the park to NA using terra::mask().\n\n# mask raster based on vector object\n# (cells outside of vector are converted to NA)\nelevation_masked &lt;- mask(elevation, boundary)\n\nOften, we will want to combine both cropping and masking to reduce the size of the raster as much as possible.\n\n# crop and mask raster\nelevation_final &lt;- mask(elevation_cropped, boundary)\n\nIn some cases, we may want to mask the raster cells inside of the boundaries (i.e. assign cells inside the park to NA).

False color images allow you to visually highlight specific features in an image that may otherwise not be readily discernible. To add to your toolbelt, you will now be plotting false color images with plotRGB() from {terra}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany Ways To Plot a False Color Image\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can plot false color composites with ggplot2 too! Check out this tutorial.\n\n\n\nThe plotRGB() function allows you to apply a stretch to normalize the colors in an image. You can either apply a linear stretch or histogram equalization. A linear stretch distributes the values across the entire histogram range defined by the max/min lower bounds of the original raster. A histogram equalization stretches dense parts of the histogram and condenses sparse parts.\nBut why would you want to normalize the colors in an image?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“When the range of pixel brightness values is closer to 0, a darker image is rendered by default. You can stretch the values to extend to the full 0-255 range of potential values to increase the visual contrast of the image. When the range of pixel brightness values is closer to 255, a lighter image is rendered by default.

It recognizes spatial objects from sf, terra, and other geospatial packages. tmap can make both static and interactive maps, as it builds on ggplot and leaflet. More detailed basemaps, like those availble from leaflet and ESRI, are only an option in interactive mode for tmap. For large-scale static data, you can load in a simple world map to use as a basemap.\ntmap allows for fine control over the locations of the title and legend.
