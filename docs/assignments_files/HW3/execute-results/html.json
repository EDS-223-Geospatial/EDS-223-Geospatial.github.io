In particular, you will use the VNP46A1 to detect differences in night lights before and after the storm to identify areas that lost electric power.\n\nTo determine the number of homes that lost power, you link (spatially join) these areas with [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/38.01/-95.84) data on buildings and roads. \n\nTo investigate potential socioeconomic factors that influenced recovery, you will link your analysis with data from the US Census Bureau.\n\n## Description\n\nFor this assignment, you must produce the following:\n\n- [ ] a set of maps comparing night light intensities before and after the first to storms\n- [ ] a map of the homes in in Houston that lost power\n- [ ]  an estimate of the number of homes in Houston that lost power \n- [ ] a map of the census tracts in Houston that lost power\n- [ ] a plot comparing the distributions of median household income for census tracts that did and did not experience blackouts\n- [ ]  a brief reflection (approx. 100 words) summarizing your results and discussing any limitations to this study\n\n## Data details\n\n### Night lights\nUse NASA's Worldview to explore the data around the day of the storm. There are several days with too much cloud cover to be useful, but 2021-02-07 and 2021-02-16 provide two clear, contrasting images to visualize the extent of the power outage in Texas.\n\nVIIRS data is distributed through NASA's [Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC)](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/). Many NASA Earth data products are distributed in 10x10 degree tiles in sinusoidal equal-area projection. Tiles are identified by their horizontal and vertical position in the grid. Houston lies on the border of tiles h08v05 and h08v06. We therefore need to download two tiles per date.\n\nAs you're learning in EDS 220, accessing, downloading, and preparing remote sensing data is a skill in it's own right! To prevent this assignment from being a large data wrangling challenge, we have downloaded and prepped the following files for you to work with, stored in the `VNP46A1` folder.\\\n\n**Data files:**\n\n-   `VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif`: tile h08v05, collected on 2021-02-07  \n-   `VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif`: tile h08v06, collected on 2021-02-07  \n-   `VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif`: tile h08v05, collected on 2021-02-16  \n-   `VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif`: tile h08v06, collected on 2021-02-16  \n\n### Roads\n**Data file:** `gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg`\nTypically highways account for a large portion of the night lights observable from space (see Google's [Earth at Night](https://earth.google.com/web/@27.44405464,-84.7693044,206.63660162a,8916361.52264659d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=CiQSIhIgMGY3ZTJkYzdlOGExMTFlNjk5MGQ2ZjgxOGQ2OWE2ZTc)). To minimize falsely identifying areas with reduced traffic as areas without power, we will ignore areas near highways.\n\n[OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://planet.openstreetmap.org/) is a collaborative project which creates publicly available geographic data of the world. Ingesting this data into a database where it can be subsetted and processed is a large undertaking. Fortunately, third party companies redistribute OSM data. We used [Geofabrik's download sites](https://download.geofabrik.de/) to retrieve a shapefile of all highways in Texas and prepared a Geopackage (`.gpkg` file) containing just the subset of roads that intersect the Houston metropolitan area.\\  \n\n[^wiki]:Wikipedia. 2021. “2021 Texas power crisis.” Last modified October 2, 2021. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Texas_power_crisis.\n\n### Houses\n**Data file:** `gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg`\n\nWe can also obtain building data from OpenStreetMap. We again downloaded from Geofabrick and prepared a GeoPackage containing only houses in the Houston metropolitan area.\\\n\n### Socioeconomic\nWe cannot readily get socioeconomic information for every home, so instead we obtained data from the [U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) for census tracts in 2019. The *folder* `ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48.gdb` is an ArcGIS [\"file geodatabase\"](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/administer-file-gdbs/file-geodatabases.htm), a multi-file proprietary format that's roughly analogous to a GeoPackage file.\\\n\nYou can use `st_layers()` to explore the contents of the geodatabase. Each layer contains a subset of the fields documents in the [ACS metadata](https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/tiger/prejoined/ACSMetadata2011.txt).\\\n\nThe geodatabase contains a layer holding the geometry information (`ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS`), separate from the layers holding the ACS attributes. You have to combine the geometry with the attributes to get a feature layer that `sf` can use. \n\n\n:::{.callout-tip icon=true}\n\nMake sure to check that these datasets have the same coordinate reference systems! If not, transform them to match.\n\n:::\n\n## Workflow outline\n\nTo complete complete the tasks of this assignment, you will need to break your analysis into the following key steps:\n\n- find locations that experienced a blackout by creating a mask\n- exclude highways from analysis\n- identify homes that experienced blackouts by combining the locations of homes and blackouts\n- identify the census tracts likely impacted by blackout\n\nBelow is guidance and suggestions for each of these steps.\n\n:::{.callout-tip icon=true}\n\nFor improved computational efficiency and easier interoperability with `sf`, I recommend using the `stars` package for raster handling.\n\n:::\n\n### Create blackout mask\nTo identify places that experienced a blackout, you should create a \"mask\" that indicates for each cell whether or not it experienced a blackout.\n\n- [ ] find the change in night lights intensity (presumably) caused by the storm\n  - hint: this will require creating a raster object for each day (2021-02-07 and 2021-02-16)\n- [ ] reclassify the difference raster, assuming that any location that experienced a drop of more than 200 nW cm^-2^sr^-1^ experienced a blackout\n- [ ] assign `NA` to all locations that experienced a drop of *less* than 200 nW cm^-2^sr^-1^ change\n- [ ] vectorize the blackout mask\n  - hint: use `st_as_sf()` to convert from a raster to a vector and fix any invalid geometries with `st_make_valid()`\n- [ ] crop (spatially subset) the blackout mask to the Houston area as defined by the following coordinates:\n    -   (-96.5, 29), (-96.5, 30.5), (-94.5, 30.5), (-94.5, 29)\n- [ ] re-project the cropped blackout dataset to `EPSG:3083` (NAD83 / Texas Centric Albers Equal Area)\n\n\n### Exclude highways from the cropped blackout mask\nHighways may have experienced changes in their night light intensities that are unrelated to the storm. Therefore, you should excluded any locations within 200 meters of all highways in the Houston area.\n\n- [ ] identify areas within 200m of all highways\n  - hint: you may need to use `st_union`\n- [ ] find areas that experienced blackouts that are further than 200m from a highway\n\n:::{.callout-tip icon=true}\nThe roads geopackage includes data on roads other than highways. However, we can avoid reading in data we don't need by taking advantage of `st_read`'s ability to subset using a SQL query.\n\nBelow is a SQL query that can be used as an argument in `st_read`:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n\"SELECT * FROM gis_osm_roads_free_1 WHERE fclass='motorway'\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n### Identify homes likely impacted by blackouts\n\n- [ ] identify homes that overlap with areas that experienced blackouts\n\n:::{.callout-tip icon=true}\nThe buildings geopackage includes data on many types of buildings. As with the roads data, we can avoid reading in data we don't need.\n\nBelow is a SQL query that can be used as an argument in `st_read`:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n\"SELECT *\nFROM gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1`\nWHERE (type IS NULL AND name IS NULL)`\nOR type in ('residential', 'apartments', 'house', 'static_caravan', 'detached')\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n### Identify the census tracts likely impacted by blackout\n\n- [ ] join the median household income from the previous 12 months to the census tract geometries\n  -   hint: make sure to join by geometry ID\n- [ ] identify census tracts that that contained homes that experienced blackouts\n\n## Rubric (specifications)\n\nYour output should serve as a stand-alone item that someone unfamiliar with the assignment would be able to understand your analysis, including the decisions made in selecting your approach and interpretation of the results.\n\nAssignments will be deemed \"Satisfactory\" based on the following criteria:\n\n#### Data analysis\n- [ ] Code must produce expected output based on correct data manipulation\n- [ ] Multiple approaches can be used to reach the correct output. Analysis must demonstrate critical interrogation of the approach used by showing justification and verification of intermediate steps. \"Correct\" answers are not sufficient.
