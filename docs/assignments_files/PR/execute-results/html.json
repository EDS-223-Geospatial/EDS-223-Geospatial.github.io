The audience for a repository is a potential collaborator(s) or employer(s) who wants to understand your workflow. Therefore, it is appropriate intermediate outputs in addition to final results as well as custom print statements and warning messages to check results. \n\nEach repository should have:\n\n- A brief, but informative name (e.g. “assignment-2” is not acceptable)\n- A clear and organized structure\n  - Should include folders for data and scripts, where appropriate\n- A `README`\n  - Contents should follow the [guidance from EDS 296](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/README-guidelines/#repository-level-readmes)\n  - Add a section articulating the skills that you are using in this repo. The idea is to make it easy for potential employers to understand your skills\n- A `.gitignore`\n  - This should include any files that you don’t want git to track  (i.e. files that you don’t want pushed to GitHub)\n- Your revised homework assignment, as a rendered Quarto document (both `.qmd` and `.html` files). Include the  following updates:\n  - Give it a brief, but informative file name (e.g. `hw2.qmd` is not acceptable)\n  - Double check that all contents meet the [standard of professional output](https://eds-223-geospatial.github.io/assignments.html#rubric)\n  - Any other updates you want to make! Including [updating the theme](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html#theme-options)\n  \n:::{.callout-warning icon=true}\n# Changing repository ownership\nYour homework submissions are technically owned by our GitHub Classroom organization. To have them appear on your GitHub profile (and be visible to others), you need to create a new repository directly from your GitHub account and copy your code over.\n:::\n  \n## Rubric\n\nTo receive a \"Satisfactory\", both repositories must include the elements described above.\n\n## Submitting assignment\n\nPlease submit your PR to [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/sSXfA8CvodbNFkRt7).\n\n\n\n",
