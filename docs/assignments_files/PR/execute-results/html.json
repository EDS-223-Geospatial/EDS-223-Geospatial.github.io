The audience of a blog post is more general than that of the repository, therefore you may be more selective in which code and output you display. In this case you are building a narrative around your work as opposed to demonstrating how it works, so you may want to only display intermediate and final results as opposed to results of self-checks and not output code. \n\n\n\n**The original assignment is a starting place.** You should use the background provided in the assignment as a starting place, but update the text and provide additional information and at least one additional reference.\n\n## Blog Post Requirements {#requirements-section}\n    \nThe style is up to you, but it should incorporate the following elements clearly:\n\n- [ ] A problem statement or question that your analysis will address\n- [ ] Background on why this issue is important (involving an additional reference)\n- [ ] Explanation of the data sources, analyses, and results\n- [ ] Clear, consistently formatted figures\n      - I.e. informative axis labels/legends, visually appealing and consistent colors and          fonts\n- [ ] Discussion of conclusions, including any potential caveats or future directions\n- [ ] Posted on your personal website\n    - [Resource on how to post a blog to your website by Sam Shanny Csik](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/)\n    - Check out [this example](https://palomacartwright.github.io/posts/2021-11-24-hurricanes-and-gdp-growth-in-the-bahamas/) from a MEDS alumn\n    \n## Submitting assignment\n\nOnce you have completed your blog post, submit the link to your blog post on this [google form](https://forms.gle/rpkAf1JRh4oCoqRF7). \n\n\n| Task                           | Due Date |\n|:-------------------------------|:--------:|\n| Blog post submission           | 12/06    |\n| Blog post feedback released    | 12/10    |\n| Blog post resubmission         | 12/12   |\n\n\n **Both a submission and a revised submission addressing all the feedback from the first revision will be needed to receive a Satisfactory.** An assignment without a resubmission will not get a *Satisfactory*, resulting in the highest possible letter grade for the course being a C. \n\n  \n## Rubric\n\nTo receive a \"Satisfactory\", the blog post must include the elements described above in the [Blogpost Requirements](#requirements-section) section.\n\n\n\n",
